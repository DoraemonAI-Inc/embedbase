Now that you have your data in Embedbase, you can ask ask questions to ChatGPT
about your data:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy {3}
const question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
const context = await embedbase.dataset(datasetId).createContext(question)
const prompt = 
    `Based on the following context:\n${context}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`
for await (const res of embedbase.useModel('openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-16k').streamText(prompt)) {
    console.log(res)
}
```
```
You might want to try our Harem Pants! They have loose legs for comfort,
and their unique bohemian style can elevate your wardrobe for work.
However, please note that they may not be the most suitable for climbing.

context = embedbase.dataset(dataset_id).create_context(question)
prompt = f'Based on the following context:\n{context}\nAnswer the user\'s question: {question}'
for result in embedbase.generate(prompt):
    print(result)
