# Self host Embedbase on Render.com

## Creating Render Account

To host on Render, you'll need to [sign up or create an account](https://render.com). It's free and supports direct login using google, GitHub and GitLab account. Or you can use email and password to signup. You need to verify your email to get full access to the platform. Just head to render/register.

## Need for GitHub or GitLab account

It's easier to deploy an application that has its source code hosted on GitHub or GitLab. Render connects with GitHub or GitLab to deploy your apps and websites automatically on every push to your project. This is very useful, as you don't have to manually deploy every time you make a change. You can either connect GitHub or GitLab or both.

## Setting up environment

You'll need to download and install Python3 to your local machine. It's better to set up a virtual environment for the application.

Next, create a folder in your preferred directory and name simple-embedbase. Next to set up virtual environment enter the command opening terminal or CMD.

Next to set up virtual environment, on Linux sometimes we need to install extra library. To do the same, just enter the command in your terminal.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Next, to initialize and activate a virtual environment on Mac and Linux, use the commands below.

```bash
python3 -m env env
source env/bin/activate
```

## Installing requirements

Make sure your package manager that is `pip` is up-to-date.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

We're going to use **OpenAI** to create embeddings and **Supabase** as a database.
So you'll need now to install Embedbase, OpenAI, and Supabase, using `pip`:

```bash
pip install embedbase openai supabase
```
Embedbase also requires an `ASGI` server, for production, such as `Uvicorn` or `Hypercorn`.

Make sure to have sat up Supabase for Embedbase to work. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.embedbase.xyz/self-hosting/deployment#setting-up-supabase).

## Coding the API

Open the folder in any text editors, you can use notepad or advanced IDE's like VS Code or Sublime Text 4. Make a new file called main.py and we use this file to write the code in.

Just copy and paste the below lines to the file. If you're good with python or professional, then you can add or modify, making the API better.

```python filename="main.py"
import os
import uvicorn
from embedbase import get_app

from embedbase.database.supabase_db import Supabase
from embedbase.embedding.openai import OpenAI


app = (
    get_app()
    .use_embedder(OpenAI(os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .use_db(Supabase(os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL"), os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")))
).run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app")
```

Save the file. 

Let's grab these keys now!

## Getting OpenAI API Key

To get the OpenAI API key, you'll need to create an account on OpenAI. It's free and you can get a key by creating an account. Just head to https://openai.com/ and click on the button `Get Started`.

Head [there](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to get your API key.

## Getting Supabase API Key

To get the Supabase API key, you'll need to create an account on Supabase. It's free and you can get a key by creating an account. Just head to https://supabase.com/ and click on the button `Get Started`.

Now open settings:

<Image src="/render-supabase-settings.png" width={800} height={500} />

And copy the URL and API key.

<Image src="/render-supabase-api-keys.png" width={800} height={500} />

Now we have all the keys, let's add them to the environment variables.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export SUPABASE_URL="https://..."
export SUPABASE_KEY="..."
```

Let's try out the code using the command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

It should run without any errors.

All done. Now we just need to create some extra files which are need by Render to identify it as a python application.

## Creating Requirements.txt

You can simply type `git+https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase`, `supabase` and `openai` in the requirements.txt file. When deploying, render will install the latest version of these modules.

```text filename="requirements.txt"
git+https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase
supabase
openai
```

(Note that we use the latest Embedbase version from GitHub, due to some issues with Render and PyPi)

## Creating a .gitignore file

`.gitignore` file helps to avoid uploading of unwanted or private files to the git clients such as GitHub or GitLab. When sharing your code with others, there are often files or parts of your project, you do not want to share. So these files or folders can be mentioned in the .gitignore file.

For this simple-embedbase we don't want to upload env and __pycache__ to the GitHub. So we mention them in the .gitignore file like this.

```.gitignore filename=".gitignore"
env
__pycache__
```

## Upload to GitHub or GitLab

We're using GitHub here, but you can use GitLab as well. I have installed git, and I have connected it to my GitHub account. You'll find many articles on how to do it, just google it. If you're using Visual Studio then it has in built GitHub plugin which makes it way easier.

## Deploying to Render.com

As we are not deploying a static site, we should choose the option Web Service.

<Image src="/render-create-service.png" width={800} height={500} />

If you have connected your GitHub account, then you can just search the repository name and find it there.

Give a name to your web-service, then to select the region which is nearest to you. Leave all other values default. For the Start command, copy and paste the below:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You need to add your keys and other environment variables like so:

<Image src="/render-service-settings.png" width={800} height={500} />

Make sure to add `PYTHON_VERSION` to at least `3.8.0` as Embedbase requires Python 3.8 or higher.

Deploying may take some time, so patiently wait. After successful deployment, you should see the message like this below.

<Image src="/render-deployment-result.png" width={800} height={500} />

Try to add some content to the Embedbase instance. 
<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'Bash']}>
  <Tab>
    **TypeScript**
```js
import { createClient } from 'embedbase-js'
const url = "http://<your-render-url>"
const embedbase = createClient(url)
const SENTENCES = [
    "The lion is the king of the savannah.",
    "The chimpanzee is a great ape.",
    "The elephant is the largest land animal.",
];
const DATASET_ID = "animals"
const add = async () => {
    const data = await embedbase
        .dataset(DATASET_ID)
        .batchAdd(SENTENCES.map((data) => ({ data })))
    console.log(data)
}
add()
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
        **Python**
```python
from embedbase_client.client import EmbedbaseClient
url = "http://<your-render-url>"
client = EmbedbaseClient(url)
SENTENCES = [
    "The lion is the king of the savannah.",
    "The chimpanzee is a great ape.",
    "The elephant is the largest land animal.",
]
DATASET_ID = "animals"
data = client.dataset(DATASET_ID).batch_add([{"data": sentence} for sentence in SENTENCES])
print(data)
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Bash**
```bash

    "The chimpanzee is a great ape."
    "The elephant is the largest land animal."
)
DATASET_ID="animals"
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"documents\": [{\"data\": \"${SENTENCES[0]}\"}, {\"data\": \"${SENTENCES[1]}\"}, {\"data\": \"${SENTENCES[2]}\"}]}" \
    $URL/v1/${DATASET_ID}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



You should get a similar response:

```json

  "results": [
        {
            "data": "The lion is the king of the savannah.",
            "embedding": [...],
            "hash": ...,
            "metadata": null
        },
        {
            "data": "The chimpanzee is a great ape.",
            "embedding": [...],
            "hash": ...,
            "metadata": null
        },
        {
            "data": "The elephant is the largest land animal.",
            "embedding": [...],
            "hash": ...,
            "metadata": null
        }
    ]
}
```

Let's try to search now


<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'Bash']}>
  <Tab>
    **TypeScript**
```js
const search = async () => {
    const data = await embedbase
        .dataset(DATASET_ID)
        .search("Animal that lives in the savannah", { limit: 1})
    console.log(data)
}
search()
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Python**
```python
data = client.dataset(DATASET_ID).search("Animal that lives in the savannah", limit=1)
print(data)
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Bash**
```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"query\": \"Animal that lives in the savannah\", \"top_k\": 1}" \
    $URL/v1/${DATASET_ID}/search
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


You should get a similar response:

>"The lion is the king of the savannah."
