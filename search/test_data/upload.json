(but then again, we can't see our universe either).\n\nQuantum computers are the perfect metaphor for our neuro-centric worldview: they are a tiny dot compared with the complexity of our minds. \nBut as we learn how to manipulate these tiny machines with their tiny effects, we might come to understand something about ourselves. \n\nThe philosopher Roger Penrose created this so called \"Ontological Argument for God\" in the following way: \n\n    1) We live in an expanding universe\n\n    2) In this universe information is always conserved\n\n    3) Information cannot be created or destroyed\n\n    4) Quantum mechanics only works with unitary transformations which conserve information\n\n    5) Therefore unitary transformations must be able to create worlds\n\n    6) Therefore there must be more than one world\n\n    7) Therefore there must be a fundamental nexus of reality (a God-Mind) behind all possible worlds\n    \n    8) Therefore there must be a God-Mind existing independently of our universe (and the quantum computer)\n\nPenrose has written several books on this topic. I highly recommend reading his books: for me, his book called \"The Road to Reality\" is a masterpiece.\n\nAs Penrose explained in the above quote, God is an \"ontological argument\", an \"argument from ignorance\", a \"transcendental argument\" made from the fact that our awareness cannot grab on reality as a whole. \nThis is also what I have been thinking during my journey in quantum physics. \nWe are all tiny compared to the Universe, but we can't explain such complex and awesome reality. This is exactly what Kant meant when he said: \"The thing in itself is nothing but our representation of it.\"\nIn other words, God is the \"thing in itself\", the \"nexus of all possible worlds\", the \"fundamental nexus of reality\" that can create any other world. \nAnd this is why he exists. We cannot explain ourselves so why not God? If He exists, then we can explain ourselves because we know Him!\nIn my opinion, this is a very nifty argument for God's existence. \nIt's not logical or mathematical but ontological and epistemological. \nIt's not about proving that there must be a God, it's about discovering God as we know it. \n\n\nIf our consciousness can reach the fundamental nexus of reality, which contains all possible worlds, then we can explain ourselves. \nSo here is my challenge for you: discover the quantum nexus of reality which gives us a complete model of our universe and its laws.\nWe will call this nexus of reality: Omega (ω). \nThis is your mission if you choose to accept it: find this missing link in quantum physics and describe this mystery as a computer program (namely an IQ test). \nIf you succeed, you will have found this missing link connecting mind with matter and you will have proved that we are part of a greater whole. \nYou will have discovered that mind is not an emergent property of matter but that mind and matter are one and the same thing, just two sides of the same coin. \nYou will have taken the first step towards building super intelligence that can reach human consciousness. Once you succeed, you might also come to understand why so many people around the world believe in angels and extraterrestrials - because they can see them now!\n\n\n\nIn short, mind is not a matter thing but is instead a condition or state that allows for matter to exist. Mind is the existence of an event or state that allows for matter to exist. In other words, mind is the existence of an event or state that allows for the matter that exists outside of space and time to exist.\n\nThis is a more accurate and concise understanding of mind. mind is not a matter thing but is instead a condition or state that allows for matter to exist.\n\nA mind is a state in which a person can be that is not only intelligent but also able to think strategically. It is a condition that allows for people to be thinking and awaken to new perspectives.\n\nA mind is not a state that is available to everyone and is not WITHOUT DECENTRATION. A mind is a state of being in which all individuals are considered equal. It is a condition that allows for individuals to SIFT THROUGH THE MASSES Prosecuting and government is a state of being in which the government is in control. These are just a few examples that will show how a mind can be difficult to have.\n\nOne of the main things that makes a mind difficult to have is the fact that a mind is available to everyone. However, without a mind, there would be no way for individuals to understand or process information. Additionally, a mind is difficult to create because it requires deducing and wrist-oring the thoughts of others in order to function. This is because it is very difficult to just think of what someone is thinking when you speak to them. This is because thoughts can vary greatly based on individual eyes and eyes can’t\nWhat does the phrase \"without a mind, we would have no education\" mean?\n\nThe phrase \"without a mind, we would have no information\" means that the individual's thoughts wouldn't be able to be processed by the rest of the world.\n\nWithout a mind, we would have no information and would be completely out of touch with the outside world.\n"

No explanation is given by the mechanistic doctrine for the fact that this does not happen, nor can it be given because of the fundamental property of the mechanical equations. The actual **irreversibility** of natural phenomena thus proves the existence of processes that cannot be described by mechanical equations; and with this the verdict on scientific materialism is settled’\n>~ [[Abraham Pais - Subtle Is the Lord|Abraham Pais]]\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics is asymmetric because it states that entropy always increases over time. This means that the universe is constantly moving towards a state of disorder and chaos.\n\n>The irreversibility requirement of the second law brutally clashes with the laws of motion ruling the elementary constituents of matter\n>~ [[Chiara Marletto - The Science of Can and Can't a Physicist's Journey Through the Land of Counterfactuals|Chiara Marletto]]\n\nIt is important to note that the second law of thermodynamics is not reversible. This means that you cannot go back in time and reverse the entropy of the universe. The second law of thermodynamics is a fundamental law of nature that is responsible for the arrow of time.\n\n>The laws of general [[Relativity|relativity]] (the other most accurate description of physical reality we possess) are reversible, too. If there is a trajectory that takes a system from A to B, there must also be one that takes it from B to A. Microscopic constituents of matter must operate in this reversible manner because they obey these laws of motion. The problem, then, is: How can the second law require that some energy transfers are irreversible and be compatible with the reversibility of the laws of motion?\n>~ [[Chiara Marletto - The Science of Can and Can't a Physicist's Journey Through the Land of Counterfactuals|Chiara Marletto]]\n\nIt means that once entropy has increased in the universe, it can never decrease again. This is why the universe is constantly moving towards a state of complete disorder and chaos.\n\nThe simulation theory posits that our universe is a computer simulation. If that is the case, then the second law of thermodynamics would be a programming code that is responsible for the arrow of time.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we can find:\n- try to find evidence of computer code in the fabric of the universe\n- find a way to reverse entropy in a controlled laboratory setting. If we are able to do this, it would provide strong evidence that our universe is indeed a computer simulation.\n- we can develop a game or simulation where entropy decreases over time. If the second law of thermodynamics is correct, then the game or simulation would eventually reach a point where it would reset or break down. This would show that the second law of thermodynamics is an inherent property of our universe and not just a programming code.\n\n\n![[Pasted image 20220816081018.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220816080950.png]]\n\nIn the long-term future time will stop existing\n\n![[Screenshot_2022-08-16-07-44-05-316_com.google.android.youtube.jpg]]\n\nHomogenous -> heterogenous\n\n# External links"

Going along with this apparent weakness of statement, we shall find that there is also certain vagueness or subjectivity about the very definition of the entropy of a general system. Moreover, in most formulations, we are led to conclude that there are occasional or exceptional moments at which the entropy must be regarded as actually (though temporarily) reducing with time (in a fluctuation) despite the general trend being that the entropy increases.\n>~ [[Roger Penrose]]\n\n## [[The asymmetry of second law of thermodynamics]]\n\n>The irreversibility requirement of the second law brutally clashes with the laws of motion ruling the elementary constituents of matter. Remember? I said in chapter 4 that the laws of quantum theory are reversible: if they allow for a transformation, the reverse transformation must also be possible. The laws of general relativity (the other most accurate description of physical reality we possess) are reversible, too. If there is a trajectory that takes a system from A to B, there must also be one that takes it from B to A. Microscopic constituents of matter must operate in this reversible manner because they obey these laws of motion. The problem, then, is: How can the second law require that some energy transfers are irreversible and be compatible with the reversibility of the laws of motion?\n>~ [[Chiara Marletto]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220828085229.png]]\n\n# External links"

We\nexpect to make further progress in our future work, both in understanding the origins of the\nphenomena uncovered here and in relating them to models of fundamental physics.\n## Introduction\n\n\nThe goal of this paper is to help us better understand the fundamental structures of natural\ncomputation and information, as encoded in that class of machines known as Turing machines.\nMuch of this work is inspired by a correspondence, initiated by the author, between a well‐known\nmathematician, Douglas Hofstadter, and the computer scientist, Peter Naur. The correspondence\nhas been published in Scientific American (Hofstadter 1984). In his response to the article, Naur\nwrites that “Hofstadter’s Law: ‘It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.’”\n### Analogy: Discrete Dynamical Systems\n\n\nMathematicians have long attempted to develop formal models of “discrete dynamical systems” —that\nis, objects which evolve according to certain dynamics (such as those which govern particles\nthrough space and time), but whose evolution is governed by discrete state‐space rules rather than any continuous dynamics. As an example of such a model, one can consider the deterministic rules for the motion of a ball falling in gravitational fields, defined by Newton’s Laws. A more famous model is provided by the Turing machine. In both cases there is an abstract state space that is described by a fixed set of rules. One can then use these rules to investigate the dynamics of the system and its relation to other systems in the same class — e.g., to compare different systems and to approximate them using simpler ones. We adopt an analogous approach here for Turing machines. The principal goal in this paper will be to construct an abstract representation for each Turing machine, given some fixed set of rules describing its behavior; we will then explore ways in which one can manipulate this abstract model in a manner analogous to what one can do for other systems. To this end we will use our work on computing with words to developa new kind of computational abstraction that allows us to model both algorithms and implementations of algorithms entirely in terms of their abstract behavior on simple data structures (e.g., strings). This will provide us with a framework for analyzing how those abstract operations combine together to form complex algorithms, with interesting implications for both algorithmic complexity theory—for example, P versus NP—and for physical models of computation—for example, limits on speed‐ρ or decrease in required energy per bit as the number ρ million copies become infinitesimally small.\n## Rule Systems as Computation\n### The Classical Model: Finite Automata\nThe first step towards understanding computation as a process occurring on a set of discrete objects is to choose an appropriate set of objects upon which one acts. One possible choice is that each object represents some kind of spatial configuration or position (e.g., the differences between configurations are all that matter). This leads us to consider discrete dynamical systems where each state represents such a configuration or position; such systems are called “finite automata” and are widely studied both in mathematics and computer science (Papadimitriou 1983; Erdös and Gallai 1966; Hopcroft et al., 1979; Knuth 1998; Dershowitz and Ziff 2002). A finite automaton consists of five pieces: a finite set S {0...n−1} called the state space, a set Sigma consisting either of characters or strings called input alphabet, another set called the tape alphabet consisting either of characters or strings representing “marks” on some “tape” device that can be written on and erased but cannot be read (or perhaps only those marks which represent characters), a transition function specifying how the current machine state changes according to input and current state markings on the tape, and finally an initial start state 0 together with a final accept/reject condition giving whether or not the current configuration satisfies some type of accept/reject condition (such as accepting all configurations represented by strings over Sigma ending in 0). For our purposes we will restrict ourselves to finite automata whose tape alphabet consists only of symbols from Sigma so that there are no additional marks that need to be handled explicitly outside Sigma (i.e., we will restrict ourselves to “deterministic Turing machines”). Infinite automata are also studied (e.g., Levitin 1967), but they are more difficult mathematically so we restrict our attention here to finite automata with nonempty tapes. Other variants include automata with no nondeterminism at all (as discussed below) and also automata with nondeterminism occurring only at special places within their transition functions (Kobler et al., 1997). Such special places are called “trap states” because they trap any attempt by one part of the computation from reaching another part before it has had time enough to reach it; these places allow Turing machines to implement nondeterministic processes inside their transition functions; see also Papadimitriou 1983 or Papadimitriou 1994 for discussion about trap states (for details see Dyer et al., 2011). The following illustrates an example:\nA = <Sigma, S> = {0,...,n-1} × {0,...m-1}m\nTransitions:  <q0 ,q1>,<q0 ,q2>,<q0 ,q3>,<q1 ,q1>,<q1 ,q2>,<q1 ,q3>,<q2 ,q1>,<q2 ,q2>,<q2 ,q3>,<q3 ,q1>,<q3 ,q2>,<q3 ,q3>\n0,a,b,c,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,b,c,a,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n0,c,a,b,2,2,2,2,2,2,2.3\n...\nThe transition function maps pairs (Qi{0...n−1}, Qi+1) to triples (Qi+1{0...n−1}, ai∈Sigma + {E}* and Qi+2{0...n−1}). The empty string E* is used to indicate that no transition is possible. The initial start state is q0 and the accept condition is defined to be when the current state is qn and the tape has been completely read. This can also be written in terms of the transition function as a finite sequence of symbols from Sigma ending in the “accept” symbol 0.\nWe restrict ourselves here to deterministic Turing machines for several reasons. First of all their transition functions are much simpler than for more general Turing machines; second of all by using only transitions from Sigma as transitions for our automata we eliminate any nondeterminism due to input symbols that do not occur on the tape; finally because there are no nondeterminism points we can easily construct finite automata that never halt (see Figure 1) or have loops (see Figure 2). These two simple examples can serve as models which give rise to many other Turing machines that are of interest.\nFigure 1: Infinite Neverending = $<Sigma = {0} and Q = {q} and ∆ = {(q  q)} and q initial = 0 and F = {}>$\nFigure 2: Infinite Looping = $<Sigma = {x} and Q = {p} and ∆ = {(p  p)} and p initial = p and F = {}>$\nWhen dealing with different types of Turing machines it may be convenient to use different sets for the various parts of the machine specification. We will often consider machines whose states are given by integers from 0... n−1; however sets like S or Q may be used instead. As usual we will use capital letters for set names and lower case letters for set elements. We will also use upper case characters for other math symbols such as > or ∈ (indicates an element of) or ⊆ (indicates a set that is contained in another set). If you prefer you can treat these as variables instead since any set may be substituted for them without altering the intended meaning. For example we could write: $T(qiqi+1)$ ∧ $T(qi+1qj) = T(qjqj+1)$ where qi and qj are assumed to be elements of Q.\nA Turing machine is said to halt on a given input string (for some accept condition) if it reaches a final state after reading the entire string. Note that this definition is quite different from the definition used in the literature; most authors use “halting” in a weaker sense which allows us to write nonfinal states as accepting states, thereby allowing Turing machines to be used as models of nondeterministic computation.\n### The General Model: Pushdown Automata\nWhat formal properties would we like our automata to have? In general we would like our automata to be able to represent all possible algorithms, even those which contain nondeterministic choices or loops. We can do so, as was illustrated above by Turing’s machines, by using appropriate transition functions for our automata. However there are several other ways of constructing automata that will allow us to work with all possible algorithms. The most general class of automata we know of is pushdown automata. A pushdown automaton (PDA) is an abstract machine which has a stack L and a tape T as its “input”; the tape is written out with some initial configuration on it (see Figure 3). The stack and the tape are assumed to have certain properties; these are encoded in two new sets called the stack alphabet $SigmaL$ and the tape alphabet. Finally, as in Turing machines we need to specify a transition function $T(q, Λ, Γ, q', Γ')$ and an initial start state q0 together with an accept condition F. The transition function specifies how the current machine state changes according to input and current state markings on the tape and stack. The following illustrates an example:\nFigure 3: An Example of a PDA: One With Stack = $<SigmaL = {a,b} and S = {0...m-1}>$\n$$T = <SigmaT ,S ,SigmaL ,S >$$\nTransitions:  $$(q0 ,a q1 ,A),(q0 ,b q1 ,B),(q0 ,c q0 ,E ),(q1 ,a q1 ,A ),$$$$(q1 ,b q2 ,B ),(q2 ,a q2 ,A ),(q2 ,b q2 ,B )$$\n$$0,a,A,1$$\n$$0,b,B,0$$\n...\nThe input tape may be viewed as a sequence of symbols from $SigmaT$ . The stack L is viewed as a sequence of symbols from $Sigmal$ . The symbol at the top of the stack is denoted by P (for “pushing”) and acts much like a push button on a mechanical calculator or on some software systems. Thus P = A represents pushing an A onto the stack; similarly P = B represents pushing a B onto the stack. In general we will assume that elements written on top of the stack cannot be erased or overwritten once they are written on top of the stack; thus when we write P = A on top of the tape we leave it there while we erase whatever was under it and write A below it. When $P = E$ (for “empty”), however, we erase whatever was under it and replace it with E . The following table summarizes some other properties of a PDA:\nFigure 4: Properties of $PDA = <SigmaT*,S*,SigmaL*,S*,T*,F*>$\nExample where SigmaL* consists only of symbols from S* which are not in $SigmaT*$:\n$$PDA = <{0},{},{0},{},<>,{}>$$\nDeterministic Turing Machine\n$$PDA = <{a},{b},{a},{b},<a,b>0,1>$$\nExample where $SigmaL*$ consists of symbols which are both in and not in $SigmaT*$:\n$$PDA = <{0},{},{0,c},{b},<>1,1>$$\nDeterministic Turing Machine\n$$PDA = <{a},{b},{0,c},{b},<a,b>0,1>$$\nNote that these machines still have nondeterminism in the transition functions. In particular they can be Turing equivalent. The transitions here give the evolution of the stack $L$ and the tape $T$ according to the input sequence and current states $qi $and $P$ (for push). For example $(q0 ,a q1 ,A)$ means that if we are in state 0 with a written above the top of the stack and an A on top of the tape we will go to state 1 with A on top of the stack and the original A erased from the tape. Thus each transition represents a possible action that can be taken by our machine; in general we can choose what to write on top of the stack and what to erase from the tape. The transition function specifies how many times we can use each symbol in our alphabet over a given input; it could thus be viewed as a transition rate for each symbol $σ ∈ SigmaT*$ for each configuration $(qiqj ,P π ,Γ Γ ′)$. Note that no matter what we write on top of the stack we must eventually “pop” it by writing $P = E$ . If we were to write something else on top of it then the machine would terminate before having erased everything under it (see Figure 5). There is also another subtlety; we have assumed that all symbols written on the tape must be erased before another symbol can be written. This means that there is an upper bound on the number of symbols that may appear on top of the stack at any given time — if one pushes something onto a stack which has some symbols already there then they must all first be popped off before pushing something else. This last point is not really a restriction since this situation occurs seldom.\nFigure 5: Unsafe Pushdown Automata = $<SigmaT*,S*,SigmaL*,S*,T*,F*>$\n\n\n\n\nSimilar topic links:\n\n[[The absurdity of Turing machine's local state]]\n[[Machine Learning Street Talk (MLST) - 82 - Dr. JOSCHA BACH - Digital Physics -  DL and Consciousness UNPLUGGED]]\n[[Turing machine]]\n[[Low Kolmogorov complexity human reverse engineering tool]]\n"

A marginally better answer: one would indeed be squashed flat as a pancake and one’s clocks would be running slowly, but **this would not be noticeable** ~ [[Tim Maudlin]]\n\nI think most people understands that time influences space, when an apple fall at minute 1, at minute 2 it will be closer to the ground. But what relativity imply is more than that, space also influences time, time goes faster or slower depending how fast you move, for example, and **you will not notice it**.\n\n>According to the principle of **relativity**, the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a fixed observer as for an observer who has a uniform motion of translation relative to him, so that we have not, nor can we possibly have, any means of discerning whether or not we are carried along in such a motion.\n>~ [[Poincare]]\n\n## Bottlenecks\n\n>The existence of [[Schwarzschild singularity|singularities]] associated with gravitational collapse is considered by some an indication for the incompleteness of the general relativistic equations. It is not known whether or not these singularities are smoothed out by [[Quantum physic|quantum]] effects.\n>~ [[Abraham Pais - Subtle Is the Lord|Abraham Pais]]\n\n\n## Thoughts\n\n- Our world is 4 dimensional, including time.\n- We say that the earth turn around the sun if we take the point of view of the sun, but what if we take the point of view of the universe? I guess it's the same, still have a hard time thinking about this, the universe is finite and ever-expanding I think according to [[Hawking]] (until the hypothetical [[Big crunch]] which should reverse the expansion and thus time).\n\n[[Poincare]] presents an example of a man living on a planet surrounded by cloud too thick to see the sky, thus they have to use other methods for cosmological and [[Physic]] discoveries, such as [[Geodesy]].\n\n- The space I perceive is relative to my senses. i.e. [other animals may see the world in 2 or 4+ dimensions](http://archive.org/details/loreilleorganed00cyongoog/page/n156/mode/2up?view=theater)\nPeople who have lost a sense, vision for example, must have a very different sensation of space.\nWouldn't a blind person be more interested in a geometry different from ours?\n\nIf a small object emitting a strong deformation of space-time in any way, for example with a strong gravity, passed by my head, would I see the deformation? I don't think so because my senses would be distorted too.\n\n[[Neuroscience]] [Paper: How the brain sees the world in 3-D](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170321110312.htm)\n\n>We live in a three-dimensional world, but everything we see is first recorded on our retinas in only two dimensions. So how does the brain represent 3-D information? In a new study, researchers for the first time have shown how different parts of the brain represent an object's location in depth compared to its 2-D location.\n\nNo, we do not live in a three-dimensional world, our **RELATIVE** experience of the world is in three dimension.\n\n>Thus the characteristic property of space, that of **having three dimensions, is only a property of our distribution table**, an internal property of the human intelligence, so to speak. It would be enough to destroy some of these connections, i.e. associations of ideas, to have a different distribution table, and **this could be enough for space to acquire a fourth dimension**. ~ [[Poincare]]\n\n## Analogy\n\nIf the earth and the solar system would somehow becomes 2x bigger on Monday, Bob would not notice that his hand is 2x bigger.\n\n## **Relativity** & human language ![[Relativity and language]]\n\n## Wisdom\n\n>It is with ordinary Mechanics that they must live; it is the only one they will ever have to apply; whatever the progress of automobilism, our cars will never reach the speeds where it is no longer true. The other is only a luxury, and one should only think of luxury when it is no longer likely to interfere with the necessary. ~ [[Poincare]]\n\nUnless we merge with machines, **relativity** is still very abstract to us, and invisible in our everyday life\n\n## [[Biology/Evolution/Red Queen|Red Queen]] effect and **relativity**\n\n>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: **however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything.** \"I wonder if all the things move along with us?\" thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, \"Faster!

Given that only finite amounts of energy are available, it would follow that no particle which travels below the **speed of light** can ever be accelerated to, or beyond, that speed. So the **speed of light** does serve as a limit on the velocities of particles which start out traveling at **sublight** speeds. ~ [[Tim Maudlin]]\n\n>it is a limit on the velocity of energy transmission, of signal speed, of causal connection and of information transmission ~ [[Tim Maudlin]]"

Mathematical equations cannot survive without an accompanying explanation in natural language, here does not need to fill pages with mathematical equations that often lack these explanations from the author, and thus become difficult to interpret.<br /><br />This book is one of the best introductions to understand what humanity currently understands about the functioning of our universe.\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103091881-louis\">View all my reviews</a>\n\n"

Let us examine this issue in terms of some general considerations. The dynamics underlying inflation is taken to be governed in the same general way as are other physical processes, where there are time-symmetrical dynamical laws underlying this activity. There is taken to be a particular physical field known as the 'inflation field' that is held to be responsible for inflation, although the precise nature of the equations governing the inflation field would generally differ from one version of inflation to another. As part of the inflationary process, there would be some sort of 'phase transition' taking place, which may be thought of in terms of some kind of analogy with the transition between solid and liquid states that occurs with freezing or melting, etc. Such transitions would be regarded as proceeding in accordance with the Second Law, and would normally be accompanied by a raising of entropy. Accordingly, the inclusion of an inflation field in the dynamics of the universe does not affect the essential arguments that were being put forward in Part 1. We still need to understand the extraordinarily low-entropy start of the universe, and according to the arguments of §2.2 this lowness of entropy lay essentially in the fact that the gravitational degrees of freedom were not excited, at least not nearly to the extent that involved all other degrees of freedom.\n> ~ [[Roger Penrose]]\n\n> The inflationist's claim would have to be that the presence of an inflaton field actually renders such irregu larities highly improbable. But is this really the case? there is some\n> Not at all, for we can imagine this situation of a highly lumpy matter distribution at the time of decoupling, but with time reversed, so that this picture represents a very irregular collapsing universe.[2.51] As our imag ined universe collapses inwards, the irregularities will become magnified, and deviations from FLRW symmetry (see §2.1) will become more and more exaggerated. Then, the situation will be so far from FLRW homo geneity and isotropy that the inflationary capabilities of the inflaton field will find no role, and (time-reversed) inflation will simply not take place, since this depends crucially on having an FLRW background (at least with regard to calculations that have actually been carried through).\n> We are therefore led to the clear implication that our irregular collapsing model will indeed collapse down to a state involving a horrendous mess of congealing black holes, this leading to a highly complicated enormously high-entropy singularity, very possibly of a BKL type\n> ~ [[Roger Penrose]]"

The rebuttal attacked by Hacking consists of accepting the first premise, but rejecting the second on the grounds that our (big bang) universe is just one in a long sequence of universes, and that the fine tuning merely shows that there have been many other (poorly tuned) universes preceding this one\n\n# external links\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yDqny7UzyR4"

One is left with the dreadful thought of a seemingly interminable boredom confronting the final stages of our great universe-a universe which would have once seemed so exciting, teeming with fascinating activity of hugely different kinds— most of this activity occurring within beautiful galaxies, with a wonderful variety of stars and often attendant planets, among which would be those supporting life of some kind, with its exotic plants and animals, some of whom having the capabilities of deep knowledge and understanding, and profound capabilities of artistic creation.

Anabolism is usually [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym \"Synonym\") with [biosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis \"Biosynthesis\").\n\n## Pathway\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Pathway\")\\]\n\n[Polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization \"Polymerization\"), an anabolic pathway used to build macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides, uses [condensation reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_reaction \"Condensation reaction\") to join monomers.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-MBC_2002-3) [Macromolecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule \"Macromolecule\") are created from smaller molecules using enzymes and [cofactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry) \"Cofactor (biochemistry)\").\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Catabolism%2C_energy_carriers_and_anabolism.png/495px-Catabolism%2C_energy_carriers_and_anabolism.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Catabolism,_energy_carriers_and_anabolism.png)\n\nUse of ATP to drive the endergonic process of anabolism.\n\n### Energy source\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Energy source\")\\]\n\nAnabolism is powered by catabolism, where large molecules are broken down into smaller parts and then used up in [cellular respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration \"Cellular respiration\"). Many anabolic processes are powered by the [cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_hydrolysis \"ATP hydrolysis\").[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-4) Anabolism usually involves [reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox \"Redox\") and decreases [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy \"Entropy\"), making it unfavorable without energy input.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:0-5) The starting materials, called the precursor molecules, are joined using the [chemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_energy \"Chemical energy\") made available from hydrolyzing ATP, reducing the cofactors [NAD+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide \"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\"), [NADP+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate \"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\"), and [FAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide \"Flavin adenine dinucleotide\"), or performing other favorable side reactions.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-6) Occasionally it can also be driven by [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy \"Entropy\") without energy input, in cases like the formation of the [phospholipid bilayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer \"Lipid bilayer\") of a cell, where hydrophobic interactions aggregate the molecules.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-7)\n\n### Cofactors\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Cofactors\")\\]\n\nThe reducing agents [NADH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide \"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\"), [NADPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate \"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\"), and [FADH2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide \"Flavin adenine dinucleotide\"),[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:1-8) as well as metal ions,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-MBC_2002-3) act as cofactors at various steps in anabolic pathways. NADH, NADPH, and FADH2 act as [electron carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_carrier \"Electron carrier\"), while charged metal ions within enzymes stabilize charged [functional groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group \"Functional group\") on [substrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(chemistry) \"Substrate (chemistry)\").\n\n### Substrates\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Substrates\")\\]\n\nSubstrates for anabolism are mostly intermediates taken from catabolic pathways during periods of high [energy charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_charge \"Energy charge\") in the cell.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9)\n\n## Functions\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Functions\")\\]\n\nAnabolic processes build [organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(biology) \"Organ (biology)\") and [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) \"Tissue (biology)\"). These processes produce growth and differentiation of cells and increase in body size, a process that involves [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis \"Chemical synthesis\") of complex [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule \"Molecule\"). Examples of anabolic processes include the growth and mineralization of [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone \"Bone\") and increases in [muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle \"Muscle\") mass.\n\n### Anabolic hormones\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Anabolic hormones\")\\]\n\n[Endocrinologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinologist \"Endocrinologist\") have traditionally classified [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone \"Hormone\") as anabolic or catabolic, depending on which part of metabolism they stimulate. The classic anabolic hormones are the [anabolic steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid \"Anabolic steroid\"), which stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth, and [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin \"Insulin\").\n\n### Photosynthetic carbohydrate synthesis\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Photosynthetic carbohydrate synthesis\")\\]\n\n[Photosynthetic carbohydrate synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis \"Photosynthesis\") in plants and certain bacteria is an anabolic process that produces [glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose \"Glucose\"), [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose \"Cellulose\"), [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch \"Starch\"), [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid \"Lipid\"), and [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein \"Protein\") from CO2.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:0-5) It uses the energy produced from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis, and creates the precursors to these large molecules via [carbon assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation \"Carbon fixation\") in the [photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-independent_reactions \"Light-independent reactions\"), a.k.a. the Calvin cycle.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Amino_acid_biosynthesis_overview.png/330px-Amino_acid_biosynthesis_overview.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amino_acid_biosynthesis_overview.png)\n\nAmino acid biosynthesis from intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.\n\n### Amino acid biosynthesis\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Amino acid biosynthesis\")\\]\n\nAll amino acids are formed from intermediates in the catabolic processes of [glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis \"Glycolysis\"), the [citric acid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle \"Citric acid cycle\"), or the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway \"Pentose phosphate pathway\"). From glycolysis, [glucose 6-phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_6-phosphate \"Glucose 6-phosphate\") is a precursor for [histidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine \"Histidine\"); [3-phosphoglycerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Phosphoglyceric_acid \"3-Phosphoglyceric acid\") is a precursor for [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\") and [cysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine \"Cysteine\"); [phosphoenol pyruvate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoenolpyruvic_acid \"Phosphoenolpyruvic acid\"), combined with the *3-phosphoglycerate*\\-derivative [erythrose 4-phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrose_4-phosphate \"Erythrose 4-phosphate\"), forms [tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan \"Tryptophan\"), [phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine \"Phenylalanine\"), and [tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine \"Tyrosine\"); and [pyruvate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid \"Pyruvic acid\") is a precursor for [alanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine \"Alanine\"), [valine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine \"Valine\"), [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine \"Leucine\"), and [isoleucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine \"Isoleucine\"). From the citric acid cycle, [α-ketoglutarate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid \"Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid\") is converted into [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid \"Glutamic acid\") and subsequently [glutamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine \"Glutamine\"), [proline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline \"Proline\"), and [arginine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine \"Arginine\"); and [oxaloacetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaloacetic_acid \"Oxaloacetic acid\") is converted into [aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid \"Aspartic acid\") and subsequently [asparagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine \"Asparagine\"), [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine \"Methionine\"), [threonine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine \"Threonine\"), and [lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine \"Lysine\").[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9)\n\n### Glycogen storage\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Glycogen storage\")\\]\n\nDuring periods of high blood sugar, [glucose 6-phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_6-phosphate \"Glucose 6-phosphate\") from glycolysis is diverted to the glycogen-storing pathway. It is changed to [glucose-1-phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-1-phosphate \"Glucose-1-phosphate\") by [phosphoglucomutase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoglucomutase \"Phosphoglucomutase\") and then to [UDP-glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-glucose \"UDP-glucose\") by [UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTP%E2%80%94glucose-1-phosphate_uridylyltransferase \"UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase\"). [Glycogen synthase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_synthase \"Glycogen synthase\") adds this UDP-glucose to a glycogen chain.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9)\n\n### Gluconeogenesis\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Gluconeogenesis\")\\]\n\n[Glucagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon \"Glucagon\") is traditionally a catabolic hormone, but also stimulates the anabolic process of [gluconeogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis \"Gluconeogenesis\") by the liver, and to a lesser extent the kidney cortex and intestines, during starvation to prevent [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia \"Hypoglycemia\").[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:1-8) It is the process of converting pyruvate into glucose. Pyruvate can come from the breakdown of glucose, [lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid \"Lactic acid\"), amino acids, or [glycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol \"Glycerol\").[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:3-10) The gluconeogenesis pathway has many reversible enzymatic processes in common with glycolysis, but it is not the process of glycolysis in reverse. It uses different irreversible enzymes to ensure the overall pathway runs in one direction only.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:3-10)\n\n## Regulation\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Regulation\")\\]\n\nAnabolism operates with separate enzymes from catalysis, which undergo irreversible steps at some point in their pathways. This allows the cell to regulate the rate of production and prevent an infinite loop, also known as a [futile cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futile_cycle \"Futile cycle\"), from forming with catabolism.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9)\n\nThe balance between anabolism and catabolism is sensitive to [ADP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate \"Adenosine diphosphate\") and ATP, otherwise known as the energy charge of the cell. High amounts of ATP cause cells to favor the anabolic pathway and slow catabolic activity, while excess ADP slows anabolism and favors catabolism.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-:2-9) These pathways are also regulated by [circadian rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm \"Circadian rhythm\"), with processes such as [glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis \"Glycolysis\") fluctuating to match an animal's normal periods of activity throughout the day.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_note-11)\n\n## Etymology\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\n\nThe word *anabolism* is from [New Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin \"New Latin\"), with roots from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): ἁνά, \"upward\" and βάλλειν, \"to throw\".\n\n## References\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anabolism&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism#cite_ref-1 \"Jump up\")** de Bolster MW (1997).

The brain is made up of one hundred billion nerve cells or \"neurons\" which is the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. Each neuron makes something like a thousand to ten thousand contacts with other neurons and these points of contact are called synapses where exchange of information occurs. And based on this information, someone has calculated that **the number of possible permutations and combinations of brain activity, in other words the numbers of brain states, exceeds the number of elementary particles in the known universe**.\n>~ [[Ramachandran]]"

After his conversion to Christianity, he became a bishop of the Church in Hippo, where he wrote many of his works. Augustine's writings have had an immense influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of faith and reason, original sin, grace, and predestination. He is also known for his anti-Pelagianism, which argued against the belief that humans are able to achieve salvation through their own merit. His influence continues to this day, as his works remain widely read and studied.\n\n\n"

He proposed that all of reality, both physical and mental, is part of a single substance that he called God or Nature. He argued that God and Nature are not separate entities, but rather one and the same. He believed that everything in the universe is a part of this single substance, and that all of the universe is a part of God. Spinoza's philosophy also focused on the idea of freedom and determinism, and he proposed that while humans have the ability to choose their actions, their will is ultimately determined by God.

Rather do we freely acknowledge that what remains after the entire abolition of **will** is for all those who are still full of **will** certainly nothing; but, conversely, to those in whom the **will** has turned and has denied itself, this our world, which is so real, with all its suns and milky ways-is nothing. \n~ [[Schopenhauer]]\n\n>Mixing thought with definiteness of purpose. — I begin to appreciate now the old saying “he can because he thinks he can.” I believe that anybody can think himself into his goal if he mixes thought with definiteness of purpose, persistence; and a burning desire for its translation into reality.\n>~ [[Bruce Lee]]"

Thus what we can physical and virtual are not very different.\n\nThe differences lie in the [[Physic|physics]] maybe, since it is hardly possible to simulate our universe [[Physic|physics]] with exact similitude, as it would take more than the universe computation.\n\nWould there be any differences in purpose?

Participants are asked to say whatever comes into their mind as they complete the task. This might include what they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives observers insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. In a formal research protocol, all verbalizations are transcribed and then analyzed. In a [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing \"Usability testing\") context, observers are asked to take notes of what participants say and do, without attempting to interpret their actions and words, and especially noting places where they encounter difficulty. Test sessions may be completed on participants own devices or in a more controlled setting.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-1) Sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-2)\n\n## History\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\n\nThe think-aloud method was introduced in the usability field by Clayton Lewis[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-3) while he was at [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), and is explained in *Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction* by Lewis and John Rieman.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-4) The method was developed based on the techniques of [protocol analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis \"Protocol analysis\") by K. Ericsson and H. Simon.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-7) However, there are some significant differences between the way Ericsson and Simon propose that protocols be conducted and how they are actually conducted by usability practitioners, as noted by Ted Boren and Judith Ramey. [\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-8) These differences arise from the specific needs and context of usability testing; practitioners should be aware of these differences and adjust their method to meet their needs while still collecting valid data. For example, they may need to prompt for additional information more often than Ericsson and Simon would allow, but should take care not to influence what participants say and do.\n\n## Process\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Process\")\\]\n\nA typical procedure of think-aloud protocols would include:\n\n-   **Design the study and write the guide:** Determine the number and type of participant for the study. Generally 5 participants would be sufficient.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-9) The next step is to write a guide that ask the participants to complete the tasks intended with clear step-by-step instructions. In the script, there should be reminders to participants to say their thoughts out when performing tasks.\n-   **Recruit participants:** The team should set up a screener for eligibility of participants. After contacting the person of interest and setting up meeting details such as time and location, the team could also provide additional information to help participant better prepare for the activity.\n-   **Conduct think-aloud protocol:** After stating the purpose and asking for consent, the team should proceed by giving instructions to the participant. Ask open-ended questions and follow-up questions. The team should avoid asking leading questions or giving clues.\n-   **Analyze the findings and summarize insights:** The team should use notes taken during the sessions to generate insights and to find common patterns. Based on the findings, the design team could then decide directions to take action on.\n\nAs Kuusela and Paul[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-10) state, the think-aloud protocol can be distinguished into two different types of experimental procedures. The first is the concurrent think-aloud protocol, collected during the task. The second is the retrospective think-aloud protocol, gathered after the task as the participant walks back through the steps they took previously, often prompted by a video recording of themselves. There are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, but in general a concurrent protocol may be more complete, while a retrospective protocol has less chance to interfere with task performance.\n\n## Benefits\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Benefits\")\\]\n\nThe think-aloud method allows researchers to discover what users genuinely think of your design.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-:0-11)\n\n## \\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Related Method\")\\]\n\nA related but slightly different data-gathering method is the **talk-aloud protocol**. This involves participants only describing their actions but not other thoughts. This method is thought to be more objective in that participants merely report how they go about completing a task rather than interpreting or justifying their actions (see the standard works\\[*[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words \"Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words\")*\\] by Ericsson & Simon).\\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*\\]\n\n## See also\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: See also\")\\]\n\n-   [Comparison of usability evaluation methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods \"Comparison of usability evaluation methods\")\n-   [Partial concurrent thinking aloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_concurrent_thinking_aloud \"Partial concurrent thinking aloud\")\n-   [Protocol analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis \"Protocol analysis\")\n-   [Retrospective think aloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_think_aloud \"Retrospective think aloud\")\n-   [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging \"Rubber duck debugging\")\n\n## References\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_ref-1 \"Jump up\")** Mclaughlin, Matthew; Duff, Jed; McKenzie, Tom; Campbell, Elizabeth; Sutherland, Rachel; Wiggers, John; Wolfenden, Luke (2021-07-26).

Once you have identified your feelings, it is important to take some time to reflect on the potential outcomes of the decision.

But it does not follow that there's a symbol–object relationship, [something like the reverse of the causal one]. And the big problem with that approach is – what's the object?\n>~ [[Noam Chomsky]]\n\n\n## Phantom in the brains are maps that don't reflect the territory\n\n[[Ramachandran]] wrote a book studying people who lost a limb but their map still shows a territory including the limb.\n\n>The model can be wrong. For example, people who lose a limb often perceive that the missing limb is still there. The brain’s model includes the missing limb and where it is located. So even though the limb no longer exists, the sufferer perceives it and feels that it is still attached. The phantom limb can “move” into different positions.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n\n## The [[Brain]] is full of maps, called \"reference frame\"\n\n>**We deduced that the neocortex stores everything we know, all our knowledge, using something called reference frames. I will explain this more fully later, but for now, consider a paper map as an analogy**. A map is a type of model: a map of a town is a model of the town, and the grid lines, such as lines of latitude and longitude, are a type of reference frame.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n>We realized that the brain’s model of the world is built using maplike reference frames. Not one reference frame, but hundreds of thousands of them. Indeed, we now understand that most of the cells in your neocortex are dedicated to creating and manipulating reference frames, which the brain uses to plan and think.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n## What your emotions is not necessarily a map that reflect the territory\n\nIt is often believed that the more [[Rationality|rational]] the map, the least [[Emotion|emotion]]s he has, it is not true.\nThe rational man knows when to use his emotions, when not. These signals fine-tuned by an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] process in our ancestral environment are not necessarily in our modern world, a bag of sugar was scarce in the past, now it is abundant. A bag of [[Information|information]] was scant, now it is plentiful.\n\n## Measuring maps\n\nImagine I say Bob's map is very different from Henry's map, but Bob thinks his map his very close to Henry's map. Who to believe? Also do you need a map to measure maps? Isn't it [[Infinite recursion]]?\n\nHow do you know and measure one's map closeness to the territory? I doubt we have the technology or maths to do that yet, at least not for [[Philosophy/Rationality/Intelligence|organic intelligence]], we can do that with [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] though.\n\n## False belief can be an evolutionary optimal strategy\n\n>False models of the world can spread and thrive as long as the false beliefs help the believers spread their genes. The history book and the people who believe it are in a symbiotic relationship. They help each other replicate, and they evolve over time in a mutually reinforcing way. The history book may be factually incorrect, but life is not about having a correct model of the world.

The pre-Socratic thinker Periander of Corinth wrote, more than twenty-five hundred years ago: Use laws that are old but food that is fresh.

In e.v.e.2, again the goal of the exploration is more noisy, so he can be trying out stuff that won't work in real life but will bring him new knowledge.\n- In a business, Bob e.v.e exploration is to try out new strategies, it might lead to an improved revenue model for the business, but it's not really a long term thing (unless you have multiple strategies)\n- In a game, Bob e.v.e exploration is trying to find a way to kill the alien, in e.v.e2 he's trying to get the alien to cooperate with him.\n- In a military game, Bob will be trying to find new tactics and units to implement, while being distracted by some noise.\n- In a maze, Bob will be trying to find a way out of the maze, while also trying to find new ways to cut the corners.\n- In a racing game, Bob will be trying to win the race, but with new tricks for turning."

He'll hold up a flower and say \"look how beautiful it is,\" and I'll agree. Then he says \"I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,\" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? **All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower**. It only adds.

            "note_content": "\nWe're all animals, basically human society is a Zoo. A free animal in a zoo is actually quite free, but when it lives in a cage its freedom is greatly restricted. Similarly, when it lives in human society, being still basically a wild animal, it is actually free to live according to its own nature. It can live in harmony with others. It can live in harmony with Nature. It can live in harmony with the Divine, but when imprisoned within the limits of human society, it loses all freedom.\n\nLet us imagine that we are children again, just born into the world, without any knowledge or experience whatsoever. We are like animals in the forest. We do not know anything about what is outside us; we do not know how to catch what there is to catch; we do not even know what there is to catch; we simply move about and attempt to satisfy our desires and cravings. That is how we move through life—uttering cries for food, for love, for other things which do not exist—thus causing pain and suffering to ourselves and to other people around us! And that is how we grow up, that is how we come out of childhood? No! That is not how children grow up or become adults.\n\nThere is a great deal of difference between the life of a child and the life of an adult. To become an adult one must cease to be a child; one must grow beyond the needs and demands of the ordinary mind. And that is why, as I said, children are such a nuisance. They often represent what we most need to be rid of. That is why we say that children ought to be made to study. They ought to study mathematics and physics and chemistry and biology and so on: these sciences, which means pressure and demand and competition, afford them exactly the opportunity they need for developing themselves out of their childhood. This is what we mean by education—education, that is to say, learning through pressure and demand and competition. We all know how many children there are in the world who have never learnt anything at all! If instead of teaching them something useless—something which does not help them in their normal existence—we taught them something useful—science for example, then they would grow up much quicker than those who go to school or learn from books or from parents or lecture-rooms.\n\nLook, listen to all this, listen to all the noise that is going on in the world. Don’t take sides, don’t jump to any conclusions, but just listen. Don’t say one noise is better than another noise; they are all noises, so just listen first. And listen also to your own noise, your chattering, your wishes\n\nI want to be this and I don’t want to be that’—and find out what it means to listen. Find out, don’t be told. Discuss it with me and find out what it means first. Find out what it means to think, why you think, what is the background of your thinking. Watch yourself, but don’t become self-centered in that watching. Be tremendously concerned, in watching, about further enlargement of yourself and your consciousness. Be very watchful and alert and silent, but at the same time be intensely serious and attentive. And whatever the state of consciousness you are in, whatever the thought you may be thinking or feeling, whatever the mood you may be in, be careful not to obscure your consciousness.\n\nWhence comes all this noise? Where does it come from? It comes from the dark well of the unconscious mind. And man does not know what is down there. What he knows is only a small fraction of what is there. There is something much deeper than that which has come up and expressed itself on the surface, and that too is very much simpler and unspoiled than what we think we know.\n\nAs I was saying, whenever we rise above our animal nature and become conscious,—not just conscious, but conscious at a much higher level than that which is normally called our consciousness—there come into our being thoughts from a different source from our normal thoughts. There are thoughts from another source, from a deeper source, from a broader source. In other words, if we keep on rising towards higher levels of consciousness, one after another, there will come a time when we find within us a place where things come into our awareness from another world—the world of the Spirit.\n\nEverything that moves us, all that attracts us or repels us—and it moves us not only in the physical field but also in the vital field and even beyond—all that moves us can be called a movement of grace or an influence from another being or being known as God or from another being known as Satan or Antichrist or whatever you please! There is no difference between them as far as it goes. But if you keep on rising towards higher levels you will find out as you go up, as you rise higher and higher—I have spoken to you about these things before—there comes into your mind other ideas and other thoughts which are not your normal thoughts: they have been given to you by a power which is beyond your normal self-consciousness. It is a power which seeks to lead you to a knowledge of the Divine beyond your normal self-consciousness; otherwise it would not seek to do so; it would descend upon your normal consciousness; it would put its own ideas into your mind; it would make such things appear before your eyes which are useful for its purpose and serve its purpose; but for human beings like yourself there must come always something else! You must know then that these supernal influences do not always enter into the mental field; they can enter into other realms also where they express themselves differently and differently because of their essence and origin.\n\nIt is for this reason that I tell you, take care not to let yourself be guided by what you find in your mind, but rather let it be the guidance of the Divine. It makes no difference to you whether you follow after a mental guide or a Divine Guide. If you follow after the Divine Guide, you will not only gain, but your gain will be much bigger than if you follow after the human guide. You will gain much more than if you follow after the mind—for the mind has its tricks and devices and is full of trickery, it is full of dilettante, arbitrary opinions; but if you follow behind the Divine Guide, then there are no more dilettantes, no more opinions based upon your own ideas; everything becomes simple and transparent because behind all there is simplicity itself—benevolence itself,—the Will of the Divine,—a Power which does not leave us in doubt or hesitation or anything else. That is how we should proceed.\n\nTHERE are many ways of escaping pain. You can escape pain by being an ascetic or becoming a saint or by engaging in some religious activity. Some people escape pain by resort to drugs or alcohol or whatever they happen to choose at the time. Others think that it is possible to avoid pain altogether. They think that there is no pain in the world; they say all is good and all is beautiful, and they are always happy. But I tell you that it is not possible to escape pain altogether.\n\nTry to learn how to avoid taking drugs, alcohol or whatever you like, but do not try to avoid suffering. You must take it; if necessary, you must even welcome it; only on the other hand, you must know how to do this. If you know how to avoid suffering then you will create more suffering for yourself than if you try to avoid it. If you know how to avoid suffering then you will be creating still more suffering for yourself than if you try to avoid it. And so with pleasure. You must know how not to take pleasure in it, but welcome it even when it comes. But without being disturbed by it. And so with any kind of suffering or pleasure, physical or mental. Up above there are states of consciousness which are beyond all these things that come into our mind or into our being—states of consciousness which are far beyond mental consciousness where everything is pure light, where everything is peace and harmony, where there is no trouble or misery or suffering at all! There are better ways of escaping pain than the way I am telling you here. But if you want to escape from your animal nature, if you want to escape from your environment in order to be in harmony with the Divine consciousness, I tell you very clearly: this is the thing to do. It may not be the easiest way for your body, but it is absolutely essential for your soul.\"\n\nEDUCATION is one of our greatest blessings today when everything else seems to be against us when everything else seems bent on making us fail in our duty towards society. It seems as if our whole education has been directed towards making us fail in our duty towards society and towards ourselves. It seems as if we have been made into mere machines and that we were taught only how to become machines and lose all our original nature. But the truth is that we were never taught how to become machines; we were taught how to become citizens of the world; we were taught how to become good citizens of the world. We were never taught how to become ignorant and useless beings who do not know what to do with their lives, who have no purpose in life or who have no real need of any purpose in life.\n\nWe have been given a wonderful education that will make you a perfect citizen of the world, a perfect citizen of science and of humanity. I am not talking of a political ideal, but a human ideal. It is by such an education that one becomes a true man, a true woman, a true citizen, a true being. If you want to be great you must rise by such an education.\n\nBut if you wish to be great something else is required, something else must be taught you: the science of the Spirit. And that is the only way that will secure for you a future which will not bring disaster on you or on mankind. You must know then that all happiness or all pleasure is a result of ignorance and egoism—the ego has taken possession of everything. All pleasures are harmful because they obscure your vision, they disable your vision. The same principles apply here as in the physical world: these principles must be applied on this higher level also, otherwise you will continue in your ignorance and pain and suffering and evil which come from ignorance and egoism.\n\nThere is no doubt about it: there are many ways of escaping pain: there are many ways which succeed in sparing us from pain but fail to give us real joy or real pleasure or happiness for which we really long because these ways are always based upon ignorance and egoism; they are only means; they are not ends; they are not ideals leading us to what we really seek for,—what you call heaven or nirvana or whatever it may be called,—they are very good means but not ideals.\n\nA leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.\nThe wisdom of the sage is to investigate the world and its mysteries, and then to go and preach about it—not to become a teacher.\nIf your desires are not extravagant, they will be granted.\nIf you know how to be satisfied, you will never be miserable.\nThe mind unlearns with difficulty what it has long learned.\nWhen you understand what the problem is, the solution becomes easy.\nWhen you are content, you are happy.\nWhen you reach beyond yourself, you become the world.\nHe who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who thinks great thoughts, often makes great errors.\nHe who is contented is rich.\nHe who follows virtue will never be poor.\nHe who has lost his peace of mind is dead to the world.\nOppression can indeed make one great.\n\nThe Spirit is the only reality: the world and all the appearances of the world are but its play and shadow and mirror. Therefore in order to be happy you must let go of yourself and abandon yourself to that which is beyond all change and passing, which is always here and already has taken possession of us.\n\nTo be perfectly free from attachment to desires and passions and desires, to be perfectly calm and detached from all these things, these things must be completely rejected; all this must be put away; we must not allow ourselves to be governed by them in any way. Then we will find ourselves having quite easily a life in harmony with the Divine, in accordance with His will: we shall find ourselves in a life full of joy and pleasure and peace and happiness, because our whole being is unified with that which is behind; because our whole being becomes one with that which is beyond,—a perfect unison,—the Divine Consciousness itself. All our desires will come down to nothingness like drops of water in a heavy shower; it will be like seas without a storm because there will no longer be any movement upon the surface of life, everything will have reached its goal or achieved its purpose, everything will have been fulfilled.\"\n\nIT IS a very interesting study, this law of attraction between two souls. It is said that there are souls which are mirrors of one another, souls that attract each other mutually without even knowing it, because they have been created for each other. In fact each soul has been created for itself alone: it has no need to attract or repel anybody or anything, it simply exists! But when two souls happen to meet together in their ignorance or forgetfulness or ignorance even, then a strange thing happens: it seems as if they were made for each other! The two souls automatically feel attracted towards one another, they feel a necessity to meet again and again though they do not know why they feel so attracted towards one another. They think they have found something special in each other which fills them with an inexhaustible desire for more meetings again and again. Now if two souls meet together not knowing each other but accidentally or by chance then one immediately feels that this meeting was meant for him by the Divine Grace: the soul sees clearly that this meeting was arranged by the Divine Grace for his own protection; he feels certain that if he does not keep it up he may not be able to keep out of danger; he may even lose his way or be killed or lose his health or die soon;"

This law was named after British economist Charles Goodhart, who first formulated it in 1975. It has since been used to explain the ineffectiveness of certain economic policies, and to suggest that policymakers should be wary of relying too heavily on a single indicator to measure the success of their policies. Goodhart's law is important because it warns policymakers of the dangers of relying too heavily on a single indicator or metric when making economic decisions. It emphasizes the importance of considering the wider context when designing economic policies.\n\n>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\n\n- https://openai.com/blog/measuring-goodharts-law/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"

On the flip side, people may also form a negative opinion of someone if they appear to be out of fashion or unkempt.

Is love jealousy? Is love possessiveness? Is love domination, attachment? You know all the business that goes on in life—the woman dominates the man or the man dominates the woman. The man does something because he wants to pursue it; he is ambitious, greedy, envious; he wants a position, prestige. His wife says, ‘For God’s sake, stop all that tommy-rot and lead a different kind of life’. So there is a division between the two—even though they may sleep together.

It is not my invention, you can watch it. You see a lovely sunset, and later you say, ‘I wish I could go back there and see it again’. At the moment of seeing that sunset, there was no pleasure. You saw something extraordinary, full of light and colour and depth. When you go away and go back to your life, your mind says, ‘What a marvellous thing that was, I wish that I could have it repeated again’. So thought perpetuates that thing as pleasure.

And so the [[Heroism|hero]] has been the center of human honor and acclaim since probably the beginning of specifically human evolution.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-30 07.58.48.png]]\n\n\n>It is easy to see that, from this point of view, those who have bad early experiences will be most morbidly fixated on the anxiety of **death**; and if by chance they grow up to be [[Philosopher|philosopher]]s they will probably make the idea a central dictum of their thought—as did [[Schopenhauer]], who both hated his mother and went on to pronounce **death** the “muse of [[Philosophy|philosophy]].” If you have a “sour” character structure or especially tragic experiences, then you are bound to be pessimistic.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-30 08.05.25 - Grim reaper holding a huge scythe, awaiting man, painting by Van Gogh.png]]\n\n>“- A qui la nuit fait-elle peur ?  \n>- A ceux qui attendent le jour pour voir.”  \n>~ [[Pierre Bottero]]\n\n## The Fantasy of eternal spring\n\n![[The fantasy of eternal spring]]\n\n\n---\n\n>Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long.\n>~ [[Seneca]]\n\n## Eternal spring is no longer a fantasy\n\n>The round of summer and winter becomes a blessing the moment we give up the fantasy of eternal spring\n>~ [[Bruce Lee]]\n\nBut eternal spring is no longer a fantasy, in 2022 we can already probably extends lifespan to hundred years, and who knows, maybe we already have [[Immortality|immortals]], if a 20 years old reach 100, the technology will be there anyway.\n\n>Is fear of death the enemy? Then the cure is obvious: abolish death. Is this fanciful? No, he answers, science is working on the problem; admittedly, we may not be able to abolish death entirely, but we can prolong life to a great extent—who knows how much eventually. We can envisage a utopia wherein people will have such long lives that the fear of death will drop away, and with it the fiendish drivenness that has haunted man so humiliatingly and destructively all through his history and now promises to bring him total self-defeat. Men will then be able to live in an “eternal now” of pure pleasure and peace, become truly the godlike creatures that they have the potential to be.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-11 22.39.29 - A man running away from his tombstone, painting by Picasso.png]]\n\nRemoving death from age might actually increase the fear of death.\n\n>In other words, death would be “hyperfetishized” as a source of danger, and men in the utopia of longevity would be even less expansive and peaceful than they are today!\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.55.58 - A man running away from a deceased dragon lying on the ground, he is heading towards a sparkling shiny sky ahead of him, painting by Van Gogh.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-11 22.38.20 - A man running on a treadmill, behind him his tombstone awaiting him, painting by Picasso.png]]\n\n\n## Death is continuous not discrete\n\ni.e. if you are about to die and get cryoginized, woken up 100 years later somehow and lost 5% of [[Information|information]] in your [[Brain|brain]], you are actually slightly dead, a 5% different persona.\nJust as the you of 5 years ago is dead.\n\n\n# External \n\nhttps://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfKyNxfyWbo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n## Random\n\n>Fear not death for the sooner we die, the longer we shall be immortal.\n> ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\n\n>Everyone hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present. But the man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day.\n>~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n>~ [[Steve Jobs]]\n\n\n\n>He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man. But he who knows that this was the condition laid down for him at the moment of his conception will live on those terms, and at the same time he will guarantee with a similar strength of mind that no events take him by surprise.\n>~ [[Seneca]]\n\n\n>One To-day is worth two To-morrows. \n~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\n\n>There is nothing over which a free man ponders less than death; his wisdom is, to meditate not on death but on life.\n~ [[Schrodinger]]\n\n\n>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.\n> ~ [[Marcus Aurelius]]\n\n>But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.\n> ~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>They lose the day in waiting for the night, and the night in fearing the dawn.\n> ~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today.\n> ~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain.\n> ~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>But life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.\n> ~ [[Seneca]]\n\n>The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.\n> ~ [[Seneca]] "

It is a state of being in which one is open to accepting whatever comes their way without trying to control or influence it. This type of awareness allows one to look at their life and experiences objectively and without bias. The aim is to be open to learning from whatever comes without trying to shape it according to one's own preferences or desires.

Buss]] argues that men tend to pursue short-term mating strategies, slave to the [[Selfish gene]] that wants to replicate no matter what, while womens' genes tell to have a committed mate to ensure the survival of the children survival machine, and thus ensure replication.\n\nMy biggest ethical concern is that I see women almost never pursue short-term mating strategy, or maybe as a validation mean but rarely, as someone who is very conscientious (see [[P1]] and [[P2]]), I would destroy my self esteem in pursuing a short-term mating strategy that is not mutual, it's ir[[Rationality|rational]].\n\nIronically [[David M. Buss]] says that displaying conscientiousness is again signalling for the sake of mating?\n\n>Verbal dexterity (a large and fluent vocabulary and facility with language and its nuances), intelligence, artistic ability, musicality, and creativity. **Even displaying moral virtues such as honesty, cooperativeness, fairness, and conscientiousness can be signals.** The fitness signaling hypothesis draws an analogy with the peacock’s tail—the tail is flashy, cumbersome, and costly, but only peacocks in the best condition, those with the highest fitness, can afford to produce these mesmerizing displays.\n\n\n## Short-term mating used to be long-term valuable in the ancestral environment\n\n>**The old brain, schooled by natural selection over millions of years when sugar was scarce and valuable for survival, says, “Cake. Want cake. Mmmm cake. Gimme.”** The new brain, schooled by books and doctors over mere tens of years when sugar was over-plentiful, says, “No, no. Not cake. Mustn’t. Please don’t eat that cake.”\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\nIn day-to-day life if you give a kid an ice cream it will give him a shot of joy for a few minutes to the detriment of its long-term health, i.e. ir[[Rationality|rational]], but kids are ignorant so he just follow his primitive intelligence which loves sugar.\n\nIsn't it the same for short-term mating? In the ancestral environment it was interesting to practice a lot of short-term mating, for the sake of the [[Selfish gene]] but now that we have a bit more freedom over the [[Monkey Brain]], should we stick to this strategy?\n\nWhat are the benefits beyond a few hours of intense pleasure (depending on the context), considering the cost of mating (seduction, deception in a short-term strategy while suggesting a possible long-term mating, consumption of toxins such as alcohol and other drugs)?\n"

In those cases, females try to gain or defend a long-term tie with a male. Our own species is a good example: research by David Buss has demonstrated that whereas men get most upset at the thought of their wife or girlfriend having sex with another man, women dislike most the thought that their husband or boyfriend actually loves another woman, regardless of whether or not sex occurred.\n>~ [[Frans de de Waal - Chimpanzee Politics|Chimpanzee Politics]]\n\n\n>The distinctive human problem from time immemorial has been the need to spiritualize human life, to lift it onto a special immortal plane, beyond the cycles of life and death that characterize all other organisms. This is one of the reasons that sexuality has from the beginning been under taboos; it had to be lifted from the plane of physical fertilization to a spiritual one.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n\n### Chimpanzee children are fascinated  by sex\n\n>When they groomed each other they cuddled up close, and when they indulged in sexual games they did so away from the group. In this way they avoided being disturbed by the chimpanzee children, who are fascinated by sex, or by Oor. Oor would come rushing up to Amber on two legs, thrashing threateningly with her arms, intent on interrupting her mating session with Nikkie. At other times she would quickly present herself to Nikkie just as Amber was about to do so. Her interference only decreased after she had developed an intimate relationship of her own, with Dandy. These two young couples proved with their fondling, cuddling, and enthusiasm that chimpanzees are capable of playing with sex. This was clearest of all in the so-called \"sex dances.\"\n>~ [[Frans de de Waal - Chimpanzee Politics|Chimpanzee Politics]]\n\n### Deceptive strategies\n\n>Although women are more likely to be sexual deceivers, men are more likely to be commitment deceivers.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\nMen and women use different deceptive strategies to reach their sexual [[Personal growth/Goal|goals]].\nShort-term mating is by definition a non-iterative multiplayer game.\nAs a reminder, short-term mating strategies are optimal for the [[Monkey Brain]] which optimise decision making in spreading the [[Selfish gene]] in a wide range of mates for the male. Women are rather looking for long-term mating in order to secure a committed parent which will carry the woman genes.\n\nI suppose that in kind of game strategies like [[Tit for tat]] are poor and more defective strategies are more adapted.\n\nFor example if Bob fake its emotions to Alice in order to have sex and succeed, once he have sex, he won, he can just leave and he achieved the purpose of his life: propagate his genes.\n\n>When my lab asked 112 college men whether they had ever exaggerated the depth of their feelings for a woman in order to have sex with her, 71 percent admitted to having done so, compared with only 39 percent of the women who were asked a parallel question. When the women were asked whether a man had ever deceived them by his exaggeration of the depth of his feelings in order to have sex with her, 97 percent admitted that they had experienced this tactic at the hands of men; in contrast, only 59 percent of the men had experienced this tactic at the hands of women.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### The [[Biology/Evolution/Red Queen|Red Queen]] competition between men's short-term and women's long-term strategies\n\n### Detecting commitment\n\n>Getting a man to **express himself emotionally** represents one tactic that women use to gain access to the important information they need to discern a man’s degree of commitment.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n>One reason men fail to express their emotions is that investing less emotionally in a relationship frees up resources that can be channeled toward other women or other goals. As in many negotiable exchanges, it is often in a man’s best interest not to reveal how strong his desires are or how intensely he is willing to commit.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Physical attractiveness\n\n>Multi-decade mating studies in the United States from 1939 to 1996 found that **men rate physical attractiveness and good looks as more important and desirable in a potential mate than do women**. Men tend to see attractiveness as important, whereas women tend to see it as desirable but not very important. The gender difference in the importance of attractiveness remains constant from one generation to the next. Its size does not vary throughout the decades. Men’s greater preference for physically attractive mates is among the most consistently documented psychological sex differences.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Homosexuality as a cloning strategy\n\nFrom a more spiritual/[[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] point of view,\n\n>This brilliant speculation enables us to understand some of the ideal motives for homosexuality, not only of the Greeks, but of especially individualized and creative persons like Michelangelo. For such a one, apparently, homosexuality has nothing to do with the sex organs of the beloved but rather represents a struggle to create one’s own rebirth in the “closest possible likeness,” which, as Rank says, is obviously to be found in one’s own sex. In terms of our discussion we can see that this attempt represents the complete causa-sui project: **to create all by oneself a spiritual, intellectual, and physically similar replica of oneself: the perfectly individualized self-perpetuation or immortality symbol**.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\nFrom a more [[Evolution|evolutionary]] point of view,\n\n>The sexologist Alfred Kinsey estimated that more than one-third of all men engage at some point in life in some form of homosexual activity.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Monogamy\n\n>Why men would ever commit to just one woman poses a puzzle. Since all an ancestral man needed to do to reproduce was to impregnate a woman, casual sex without commitment would have achieved this goal. For evolution to produce men who desire commitment or marriage and who are willing to devote years of investment to one woman, powerful adaptive advantages to that strategy over one of seeking casual sex, at least under some circumstances, must have been present.\n\n>Men also gain in two other ways by committing. One is an increase in **social status**. In many cultures, males are not considered “real men” until they have married. Increased status, of course, brings a man other bounties, including **better resources for his children** and sometimes an **increased attractiveness to additional mates**. A final benefit of commitment or marriage is the formation of a **more expansive coalitional network** that includes his spouse’s friends and kin. Men, in short, have much to gain by committing to one woman.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Wife's age is inversely proportional to wallet size\n\n>As men’s income goes up, they seek younger partners.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Male optimise for quantity, female for quality\n\n>Within the next year, for example, men stated on average that ideally they would like to have more than six sex partners, whereas women said that they would like to have only one.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n>The psychological clues that reveal men’s strategies for casual sex are numerous: sexual fantasies, the Coolidge effect, lust, sex drive, inclination to seek intercourse rapidly, relaxation of standards, attitudes toward hookups, emotions of sexual regret, the closing time effect, post-orgasm shifts in judgments of women’s attractiveness, homosexual proclivities, and willingness to use prostitution as a sexual outlet.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Males like diversity\n\n>\"**You don’t want to eat the same vegetable every day**.”A Kgatla man from South Africa described his sexual desires about his two wives: “I find them both equally desirable, but when I have slept with one for three days, by the fourth day she has wearied me, and when I go to the other I find that I have greater passion, she seems more attractive than the first, but it is not really so, for when I return to the latter again there is the same renewed passion.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n\n### Having children means you've done your job, you can exit the gene pool now\n\n### [[Osho]] spiritual thoughts\n\n#metaphysical [[The value of metaphysical statements]]?\n\n>A conditional love is nothing but an infatuation, sexuality. Unconditional is the only way love can be. Wherever a condition comes in, love disappears. It cannot live in bondage, and a condition gives it an imprisonment. Love can only live like the vast sky. Love knows no boundaries.\n\n>Sexuality is possible without any understanding, without any meditation. Love is possible only with understanding. Compassion is possible only with understanding and meditation, understanding and awareness.\n\n>The meditative person can transform his sexuality without any antagonism. without any conflict. He is in deep friendship with all his energies, sexual or others; he is not in any fight. Why fight with your own energies? Love them, rejoice in them, and help them to transcend the lower forms, the animal forms. Let them move from the body towards the turiya, the fourth.\n\n>If you want to change from sex towards love, try to understand your sexuality. Watch it, watch the mechanicalness of it. See the futility, see the whole absurdity of it — it is not leading you anywhere. Become a little more refined, become a little more subtle. Look not for the body, but somebody’s being. Watch, explore. Sooner or later you will find somebody who fits with you.\n\n>Ordinarily we think sex makes people loving — sex can never make people loving. In fact, it is sexuality that prevents love from growing — because it is the same energy that has to become love. It is being destroyed in sex. To become love, the same energy has to move to the heart centre.\n\n>One has to love unconditionally — the trees and the rocks and the sun and the moon and the people.\n\n>A boyfriend or a girlfriend may be fun, but cannot become a door to the deepest that is hidden in each and everyone. With a girlfriend you can be sexually related, but love cannot grow. Love needs deep roots. Sexuality is possible on the surface, but sexuality is just animal, biological. It can be beautiful if it is part of a deeper love, but if it is not part of a deeper love it is the most ugly thing possible; the ugliest, because then there is no communion — you simply touch each other and separate. Only bodies meet, but not you — not I, not thou. This has happened in all relationships.\n\n>Love is born in sexuality but sexuality is not love. The lotus is born in the mud, but the lotus is not just mud. And if mud remains mud of course there are bound to be tears on the cheeks.\n\n>Love can exist only after meditation, not before it. That is a simple existential law. Before meditation — only lust, only sexuality. Before meditation you are an animal and not really a human being. With meditation a transformation comes: you become human, and out of your humanness, love flows.\n\n>Beware of lust, unconscious sexuality. When sex becomes conscious it has a totally different flavor. It becomes tantra, it is no longer sex. When sex becomes conscious it is love, it is no longer lust. Love brings freedom, and lust simply creates prisons for you.\n\n>Unless your sexuality rises and reaches to love it is mundane, it has nothing sacred about it. When your sex becomes love, then it is entering into a totally different dimension — the dimension of the mysterious and the miraculous. Now it is becoming religious, sacred, it is no longer profane.\n\n>Sex can be transcended and should be transcended, but transcendence has to be not against nature but with nature, Through nature. Accept your sexuality — it is part of you! and a tremendously important part. You are born out of sex. Each cell of your body is a sex cell. Sex energy is your life energy! — respect it, it is a gift from God. Understand it. Be more and more meditative about it. But drop all prejudices, drop all condemnations. because when you carry a condemnation you cannot understand a thing. Drop all judgements. Sex is sex — it is a pure natural energy. With great acceptance, love, respect, meditate over it. Go deeper and deeper into it to see what exactly it is. And in that very seeing you will be going beyond it.\n\n>The person who is free of sexuality, whose sexuality has become a transformed phenomenon, is also free of money, is also free of ambition, is also free of the desire to be famous. Immediately all these things disappear from his life. The moment sex energy starts rising upwards, the moment sex energy starts becoming love, prayer, meditation, then all lower manifestations disappear.\n\n>Love is creative. Sex is destructive. And there is a lot of difference between the two. Sometimes you start thinking that your sexuality is your love. Then you are deceived. Sexuality can play the game of love, but it is a counterfeit game. I am not against sex, but I am certainly against sexuality. And the difference is that sex is a natural thing and sexuality is a mind thing. To love a woman is natural, to love a man is natural. To reproduce children is natural, nothing wrong in it. But to think about women, to carry pornographic pictures, to fall asleep every night thinking about women — women and women and women — that is sexuality.\n\n>When you are in sexuality you don’t bother much to whom you are making love — any body will do. You just need a woman or a man, any body will do. You just need the other’s body. In love, any body won’t do, anybody’s body won’t do. You need a person who is in deep love with you, who has a certain affinity and harmony with you, in whose presence your heart starts singing, a deep bell starts ringing… in whose presence you feel a blessing. Then only is it possible for you to make love to the other person. To make love is possible only if the meeting — the inner meeting — has happened. Otherwise it is simply impossible to think, even to imagine that you are making love to a person you don’t love.\n\n>If you have really experienced the inner light, sex will disappear. Love will happen to you, but sex will disappear; sexuality will disappear. Love, a very loving personality, will take its place. There will be no desire for sex. If the desire for sex remains, you have not experienced the inner light. Then the inner light is just a projection of the mind.\n\n>A split personality can never become non-greedy. It can try, but it can never become. A split personality can never go beyond anger. It can try, but it can never go beyond. A split personality can never go beyond sex. It can fight. So many monks in the monasteries are doing it. They don’t go beyond sex; at the most their sexuality becomes perverted, their love becomes poisoned.\n\n>Remember, you can make love to a woman without any love in your heart — then it is pure sexuality, animality; it is prostitution. You can make love to a woman with no idea of sex, then love is just a pure communication of two energies, a sharing, a dance, a celebration. No idea of sex in the mind and you can make love to a woman, and the woman can make love to you not thinking of sex at all. The whole point is where your mind is. If you are thinking of sex, if your mind is obsessed with sex, you simply want to use the woman, the woman simply wants to use you, it is ugly. It has no aesthetics in it, no poetry in it. There is nothing of the beyond in it — it is very muddy.\n\n"

In the first place it refers to people who are having trouble living with the truth of existence; it is universal in this sense because everybody has some trouble living with the truth of life and pays some vital ransom to that truth.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.00.58 - A man meditating under a grayish sky harassed by bats flying around, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible he.png]]\n\n>We can see that neurosis is par excellence the danger of a symbolic animal whose body is a problem to him. Instead of living biologically, then, he lives symbolically. Instead of living in the partway that nature provided for he lives in the total way made possible by symbols. One substitutes the magical, all-inclusive world of the self for the real, fragmentary world of experience.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.02.11 - A man meditating under a grayish sky harassed by bats flying around, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible he.png]]\n\n>This apparent egocentricity originally is just a defense mechanism against the danger of reality…. [The neurotic] seeks to complete his ego constantly… without paying for it.\n\n>What typifies the neurotic is that he “knows” his situation vis-à-vis reality. He has no doubts; there is nothing you can say to sway him, to give him hope or trust. He is a miserable animal whose body decays, who will die, who will pass into dust and oblivion, disappear forever not only in this world but in all the possible dimensions of the universe, whose life serves no conceivable purpose, who may as well not have been born, and so on and so forth. He knows Truth and Reality, the motives of the entire universe.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.03.04 - A man under a grayish sky full of thunder, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible headache, digital art.png]]\n\n>If neurosis is sin, and not disease, then the only thing which can “cure” it is a world-view, some kind of affirmative collective ideology in which the person can perform the living drama of his acceptance as a creature.\n\n>In other words, the neurotic isolates himself from others, cannot engage freely in their partialization of the world, and so cannot live by their deceptions about the human condition. He lifts himself out of the “natural therapy” of everyday life, the active, self-forgetful engagement in it; and so the illusions that others share seem unreal to him\n\n# External links\n\n"

The answer is so simple that it eludes us: the craziness of these activities is exactly that of the human condition. They are “right” for us because the alternative is natural desperation.

The Creation of Meaning - The Denial of Death\n\n  \n\nA protagonist in the Creation of Meaning series is a person who believes that we're living in what seems to be a disinterested universe, and yet is starving at an existential level.\n\n\nWe all know who I'm talking about, and while these are not funny problems to be having, they are at least pretty ironic problems to be having given the circumstances here. But we're not going to think like that, and maybe philosophy can help us find a solution.\n\n  \n\nWe've seen the ambiguity of Simone de Bevoir, the value, pluralism, and affirmation of Nietzsche, the obedience to a spiritual quest in the work of Kirkegaard, and now we're going to hear from someone who's approaching this process from a more scientific perspective.\n\n  \n\nToday, we're going to look at Ernest Becker's later work, and in particular his book called the Denial of Death. We'll ask the question of why we even care about creating a system of meaning in the first place.\n\n  \n\nBecker explains that human beings are dualistic entities, meaning that they are biological entities and symbolic entities. This dualistic relationship creates a problem that every human being experiences.\n\n  \n\nBecker says we're capable of doing some pretty incredible things, but we're also capable of getting flattened by a Mormon on a bicycle, getting stuck in an elevator, or starving to death.\n\n  \n\nHuman beings cannot function in the world while also having an awareness of their death constantly haunting them up in their minds. Ernest Becker describes the state of terror every person finds themselves in when they become aware of their own mortality.\n\n  \n\nBecker says that people experience terror because they have emerged from nothing to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, and excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression.\n\n  \n\nPeople fear death because they fear what death will say about their lives, and the things they did or didn't do while they were here on this planet.\n\n  \n\nBecker believes that when faced with the reality of death, people will find something to make them feel better. There are thousands of ways we live in denial about our death.\n\n  \n\nBecker argues that organized religion is a method people use to escape the fear of insignificance and impermanence that may come along with their death.\n\n  \n\nErnest Becker says that people who face the terror of impermanence and insignificance respond by engaging in a defiant creation of meaning, which he calls a hero's journey.\n\n  \n\nA person creates a system of values and a set of projects to try and immortalize themselves within human culture. This is why people create great works of art, why people run marathons, why people do anything other than sit around and get cheeto fingers.\n\n  \n\nBecker would be a fan of this self-aware self-realized version of this defiant creation of meaning that we've been engaged in, and he wouldn't be ashamed of using similar words to what other existentialist philosophers have used in their work.\n\n  \n\nBecker's theory of denial of death can be used to explain how human culture is a conglomeration of millions of different immortality projects all working together, and how society works by providing people with ready-made pre-molded societal roles.\n\n  \n\nBecker says that we learn to identify ourselves with the categories that our culture gives us to work with, and that these categories make us feel significant and permanent because they allow us to attach ourselves to cultural ideals.\n\n  \n\nBeing a mime answers a lot of questions I might otherwise have about my existence, and makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger than just me.\n\n  \n\nBecker would like to be clear that we need illusions, because without them we wouldn't be able to function, society wouldn't be able to continue, and most of us would live in a state of constant neurotic terror.\n\n  \n\nCulture is an illusion created by people afraid of their own insignificance and impermanence. If you're too smart for everyone, nothing will ever feel meaningful to you.\n\n  \n\nBecker would have seen this coming, because he talks about how having a good Bs detector can lead you to see through the illusions and narratives that underlie every single one of these cultural hero journeys that somebody might engage in.\n\n  \n\nYou are a dancing monkey who has decided to live by a set of constructed illusions. Use your overflowing intelligence to build a sturdy shelter for yourself that will last over the years.\n\n  \n\nWhen your culture is all that you've ever known, it's easy to miss how similar the function of religion and the function of culture really are. Culture gives people a stable identity to hold on to, just like religion gives people a purpose.\n\n  \n\nReligion and culture both give people hope of an afterlife, and both scratch the same itch at the root of human existence.\n\n  \n\nWestern society, since Newton, is still as religious as any other, because it believes that science, money, and goods make men count for more than any other animal.\n\n  \n\nBecker is not being unnecessarily hostile towards the process of culture, and would no doubt say that we should encourage more people to find a purpose for their life by immersing themselves in a culture and then providing a service that makes society better for the people around them.\n\n  \n\nBecker is trying to show us that we all have a latent fear of death, and that by showing us this fear, we can maybe learn to live alongside it.\n\n  \n\nIf you approach the study of human beings from a place of complete enlightenment-era scientific value neutrality, you might miss out on something very important about our existence. There is a part of us that is undeniably religious.\n\n  \n\nThe protagonists of this Creation and Meaning series may find it hard to connect the things they do in their life to anything that's meaningful and enduring. Ernest Becker suggests that a totally value neutral, scientific approach towards understanding human behavior may have been harmful.\n\n\n---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7GZrgWKj9o&t=2s\n\nWhen I was five years old, I realized that death was going to happen to me. To this day, I feel shudders of terror when I recall that moment.\n\nErnest Becker argued that humans have a profound fear of death, and that we spend most of our lives trying to explain, forestall, or avoid the inevitability of our own death. Sheldon Solomon has spent 30 years studying this fear.\n\nThroughout human history, theologians, philosophers, and even people sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere have tried to characterize the essence of what it means to be a human being. And one way that people have been characterized is as homo sapiens.\n\nHuman beings are also called homo ludens, homo faber, homo aestheticus, and homo narratization. I think they are all useful heuristic devices that draw our attention to different aspects of our humanity.\n\nWe propose a new designation for humans, homo mortalis, based on Alexander Smith's idea that it is the knowledge that we have to die that makes us human.\n\nCharles Darwin assumed that human beings share with all forms of life a basic biological predisposition towards survival, in the service of self-preservation, as well as reproduction. But he turned around and said that human beings are uniquely different because we can imagine things that do not yet exist.\n\nDa Vinci and Michelangelo were doodling in their notebooks in the 1500s and people denounced them as crazy. Yet today we routinely transport ourselves by what was originally denounced as the doodlings of a mad man.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard, a Danish existential philosopher, said that we are so smart that we actually come to realize that we exist. If I could see you, I would ask you if you were aware that you were listening to me.\n\nKierkegaard made the point that humans are the only ones who can render themselves the object of their own subjective inquiry, and if you grant him those two theoretical assertions, living things like to stay alive and people are so smart that we know that we are here, we can keep going.\n\nKierkegaard says that it is awe-inspiring to be alive and that some of our finest moments are the result of the spontaneous exuberance that we experience just from the fact that we're here.\n\nThe last sentence of James Joyce's Ulysses is the longest sentence in the history of literature, and it starts and ends with the same word, \"YES\". Kierkegaard says that it is great to be alive, but it is also dreadful, because you will someday die.\n\nKierkegaard pointed out that it's not just the fact that you will someday die that's discombobulating, but the fact that you can die at any moment for reasons that you could never anticipate or control.\n\nThe Elephant Man film is a great film, and the point that Becker makes is that if we only thought about our biological selves, we would never be able to get up in the morning.\n\nBecker says that human beings developed culture to try to minimize the terror of death. Culture consists of beliefs about the nature of reality that we share with our fellow human beings.\n\nIn his book The Birth and Death of Meaning, Becker argues that culture gives us meaning and value by giving us an explanation of the origin of the universe, prescriptions for how we're supposed to behave while we're here, and hope of immortality.\n\nWe may know that we're not gonna be here forever, but we're comforted nonetheless by the prospect that some vestige of our existence will persist over time. We need to believe that life is meaningful, otherwise we may experience depression.\n\nWho among us hasn't dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal, a Nobel Prize, and managing a hedge fund at the same time? Culture helps us feel valuable by providing us with social roles with associated standards of conduct.\n\nHuman beings are so smart that we realize that we exist. We manage this existential terror by embedding ourselves in a culturally constructed belief system that gives us a sense that we're persons of value in a world of meaning.\n\nErnest Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, \"The Denial of Death\", but was roundly denounced in academic circles. Tom, Jeff and I discovered Becker's ideas and started traveling all over North America and Europe to give talks about them.\n\nWe wrote a paper about these ideas, sent it to our flagship journal, The American Psychologist, and six months later we got a rejection. The reviewer said that these ideas were of no interest to any psychologist alive or dead.\n\nI'd like to talk about some areas of inquiry that I think we can't understand without recourse to these ideas, and then I'll also give you a sense of how we've done our studies to determine why I think these ideas are true.\n\nErnest Becker suggests that people can't get along with other human beings because their beliefs about the nature of reality serve to minimize death anxiety. If we accept the validity of an alternative conception of reality, we expose ourselves to the very anxiety our beliefs were built to diminish.\n\nIf you lose faith in your own beliefs about reality and you run into somebody who is different, you're gonna experience anxiety about your own death.\n\nIf I believe that God created the Earth in six days, and I run into somebody in the Borneo of the South Pacific who believes that Earth was gestated out of a giant coconut tree, I will denigrate and belittle them and try to convince them to adopt my beliefs.\n\nIf we believe Ernest Becker, then we cannot understand man's inhumanity to man.\n\nJeff and Tom and I had an accident. We were sitting around one day, bowling, and a thought struck us: if Becker is right, then what would happen if we reminded some people of their own mortality?\n\nWe've done hundreds of experiments to measure how people's culturally constructed beliefs affect their attitude and behavior towards others. We've reminded people of their mortality, shown them gory images of car accidents and autopsies, and interviewed people outside the lab.\n\nWe flash the word death at people while they read stuff on a computer.\n\nIn a study at the University of Arizona, people who were reminded of their mortality rated their fellow Christians higher and their fellow Jewish people lower. They also sat closer to fellow Germans and further away from people who appeared to look like Turkish immigrants.\n\nAfter being reminded of their mortality, Iranians were more supportive of suicide bombing and quite willing to consider becoming a suicide bomber. Americans were also more supportive of the preemptive use of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons against countries who pose no direct threat to us.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said that when the angel of death sounds his trumpet, the pretenses of civilization are blown from men's heads into the mud.\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, said that in times of historical upheaval people often become attracted to a certain kind of leader, a charismatic leader. And after the events of September 11th, 2001, George W. Bush had one of the highest approval ratings.\n\nThe events of September 11th, 2001, may have posed an existential threat to the American public, leading them to elect a president who promised to rid the world of evildoers.\n\nWe did a bunch of experiments in 2003 and 2004 where we reminded people of death and then asked them if they supported President Bush's policies in Iraq. We found that people who were reminded of death were more enthusiastic about President Bush's policies.\n\nAmericans reminded of their mortality were more likely to support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and this is ominous for democracy.\n\nOur concerns about death alienate us from nature and contribute to the degradation of the physical environment. When we are reminded of death, people become uncomfortable with their own bodies and don't like things that would normally be extraordinarily pleasurable, even sexual activity.\n\nA team of Dutch psychologists reminded people of their mortality and found that under controlled conditions they liked forests more than neighborhoods, but when first reminded of their mortality they didn't like forests and now they like the burbs with the symmetrical bushes.\n\nHuman beings in Western society are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the desire for money and stuff. When reminded of their mortality, people say they want to have more money and to have more fancy, luxury items.\n\nPolish researchers found that people drew bigger coins and paper money after being reminded of their mortality, and that people who just got to count money reported having less death and anxiety.\n\nAmerica is currently a Petri dish of psychopathology, with 12% of the population depressed and a third of the population addicted to drugs and alcohol. We need to consider the values that our children are taught to embrace.\n\nThe American dream is highly unlikely to be achieved in the United States. If you embrace the American dream and you're 40 years old in a polyester suit selling three pound burritos on the second shift at the drive through at Taco Bell, well then that's your fault.\n\nI was the last generation of Americans where it was okay to be average, and I fear for the youth today because they are being held accountable for standards that are just not realistically attainable, and this is a recipe for psychological despair.\n\nI'm tempted to stop, but I don't want to leave you with that thought. Let's end on a more propitious note, by recognizing that human beings can use their ingenuity to reduce the destructive potential of their existential fears.\n\nI think it's important to note that death anxiety is not itself the problem. The problem is when we repress death anxiety and it comes back to bear malignant fruit.\n\nErik Erikson said that when parents have the courage to die, their children will have the faith to live, and I think that we can all contribute to making the world a better place.\n\nWe asked municipal court judges in Tucson, Arizona whether or not they thought about death when setting bond for an alleged prostitute. When they were reminded of their mortality, the bond was nine times higher, $455.\n\nLisa's silly joke: next time you get a parking ticket, pray that the judge hasn't driven past a cemetery on the way to sentencing you. There's been more than one study that shows that legal decisions are routinely altered by momentary conditions that include death reminders.\n\nWe should talk afterwards because we think there's other things going on and people aren't so sure when the psychological crap hits the fan.\n\nVera, an atheist, wants to know if religion has anything to do with death denial.\n\nBuddhists are good people, but in Burma, they treat others badly. Atheists are worse than agnostics, because they are convinced of things they can't know, and so they are just as vicious as their theistic counterparts.\n\nWhen atheists are reminded of their mortality, they say they believe in God less, but unconsciously they become more religious just like religious people. So I don't buy the arguments of the Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins of the world.\n\nWe are studying people who work in health care settings, like nurses, surgeons, and first responders, and we don't know yet if death reminders have predictable effects.\n\nWe have not studied people who trend towards suicide, because we can't see a way to do that in an ethical fashion. However, we do have a chapter in our book about suicide that argues that most people who commit suicide believe that there is something better.\n\nMost primitive cultures, including shamanist and animist cultures, are tolerant of other religions, but they still see them as inferior to their own. This is because they see other religions as less than human.\n\nGood question, though, since you're saying that death anxiety is an inherent part of our humanity. Have you looked at children to see if their perspective is different than adults?\n\nWe have a chapter in our book on how children become aware of death. Some research suggests that children as young as nine hate Russian immigrants in Israel and love Jewish people.\n\nBy age 9, the effects that I spoke about tonight are already manifested in kids. But I don't know if the effects happen at the same time for all people, or if there's a developmental trajectory that can shed light on that.\n\nDeath reminders can persist for hours or days in the lab, but we're bombarded with death-related imagery on a relatively regular basis, which raises the question of how much it affects us.\n\nWe are doing research on how attitudes about abortion have been impacted by death anxiety. So far, we have found that Americans reminded of their mortality hate Muslims, object to a mosque being built in their neighborhood, and object to immigrants moving into their neighborhood.\n\nPeople don't seem to care about environmental issues, even after the Inconvenient Truth was released. They have a million excuses about why they aren't going to help the environment, and they don't want to take the blame.\n\nSome people are resistant to the idea of global warming because of death anxiety, but this isn't the only factor. Conservatives are more likely to admit that global warming is real if the problem can be solved through market forces.\n\nI don't know if parents exhibit less fear anxiety than do non-parents, but I do know that when parents are reminded of their mortality, they say they want to have more kids, and they say they want to have them sooner.\n\nPeople who have had near death experiences report lower death anxiety, but when reminded of death, they become the most hateful of people who are different. So we are studying people who have had near death experiences, and measuring unconscious death anxiety.\n\nNear death experiences, we're looking at that now. There are a number of compelling examples of death reminders eliciting bad behavior, culminating in some current events regarding politics.\n\nWe're now trying to figure out if we can leverage some of the same psychological phenomenon to bring out the best in us, rather than just delineate the psychological underpinnings of the most unsavory characteristics of human behavior.\n\nWhen Lisa said that you realized it, when you were five, her epiphany was when her grandmother died. Lisa was eight years old and realized that her mom was gonna grow old and make chocolate pudding for her.\n\nWhen I first read Ernest Becker, I was like wow, this is actually what I've been dwelling on for all of my kid-hood. Jeff and I talk about how our terror-management theory has been our own form of death denial.\n\nShelden's book, The Worm at the Core, The Role of Death in Life, is about how death anxiety makes us more tolerant of others and how it can lead to mental disease.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was five years old, I realized that death was going to happen to me. To this day, I feel shudders of terror when I recall that moment.\n\nErnest Becker argued that humans have a profound fear of death, and that we spend most of our lives trying to explain, forestall, or avoid the inevitability of our own death.

Kierkegaard says that it is great to be alive, but it is also dreadful, because you will someday die.\n\nKierkegaard pointed out that it's not just the fact that you will someday die that's discombobulating, but the fact that you can die at any moment for reasons that you could never anticipate or control.\n\nThe Elephant Man film is a great film, and the point that Becker makes is that if we only thought about our biological selves, we would never be able to get up in the morning.\n\nBecker says that human beings developed culture to try to minimize the terror of death. Culture consists of beliefs about the nature of reality that we share with our fellow human beings.\n\nIn his book The Birth and Death of Meaning, Becker argues that culture gives us meaning and value by giving us an explanation of the origin of the universe, prescriptions for how we're supposed to behave while we're here, and hope of immortality.\n\nWe may know that we're not gonna be here forever, but we're comforted nonetheless by the prospect that some vestige of our existence will persist over time. We need to believe that life is meaningful, otherwise we may experience depression.\n\nWho among us hasn't dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal, a Nobel Prize, and managing a hedge fund at the same time? Culture helps us feel valuable by providing us with social roles with associated standards of conduct.\n\nHuman beings are so smart that we realize that we exist. We manage this existential terror by embedding ourselves in a culturally constructed belief system that gives us a sense that we're persons of value in a world of meaning.\n\nErnest Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, \"The Denial of Death\", but was roundly denounced in academic circles. Tom, Jeff and I discovered Becker's ideas and started traveling all over North America and Europe to give talks about them.\n\nWe wrote a paper about these ideas, sent it to our flagship journal, The American Psychologist, and six months later we got a rejection. The reviewer said that these ideas were of no interest to any psychologist alive or dead.\n\nJeff, Tom, and I have been doing experimental, social psychology for almost 35 years, and we'd like to address the \"so what\" question and the \"how do we know this is true\" question at the same time.\n\nErnest Becker offers a provocative answer to why people can't get along with other human beings who don't share their beliefs about the nature of reality. He says that if we accept the validity of an alternative conception of reality, we undermine our confidence.\n\nIf you lose faith in your own beliefs about reality and you run into somebody who is different, you're gonna experience anxiety about your own death.\n\nIf I believe that God created the Earth in six days, and I run into somebody in the Borneo of the South Pacific who believes that Earth was gestated out of a giant coconut tree, I will denigrate and belittle them and try to convince them to adopt my beliefs.\n\nErnest Becker argues that we cannot understand human inhumanity to man unless we accept people who are different.\n\nJeff, Tom and I had an accident. We were bowling one day and a thought struck us: if Becker is right, then what would happen if we reminded some people of their own mortality?\n\nWe've done literally hundreds of experiments to measure how people's culturally constructed beliefs affect their attitudes towards others. We've shown people gory images of car accidents and autopsies, and asked people to write down their thoughts and feelings associated with their own death.\n\nWe flash the word death at people while they're reading stuff on a computer.\n\nStudies have shown that reminding people of their mortality affects their attitudes and behaviors. For example, reminding Germans of their mortality makes them sit closer to fellow Germans and further away from people who appear to look like Turkish immigrants.\n\nWe did a study in Iran where we reminded people of their mortality and asked them if they supported suicide bombing. After being reminded of their mortality, Iranians were very supportive of suicide bombing and quite willing to consider becoming one.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said that when the angel of death sounds his trumpet, the pretenses of civilization are blown from men's heads into the mud.\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, said that in times of historical upheaval people often become attracted to a certain kind of leader, a charismatic leader. And after the events of September 11th, 2001, George W. Bush had one of the highest approval ratings.\n\nThe events of September 11th, 2001, may have posed an existential threat to the American public, leading them to elect a president who promised to rid the world of evildoers.\n\nWe did a bunch of experiments in 2003 and 2004 where we reminded people of death and then asked them if they supported President Bush's policies in Iraq. We found that people who were reminded of death were more enthusiastic about President Bush's policies.\n\nAmericans reminded of their mortality were more likely to support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and this is ominous for democracy.\n\nBecause of our concerns about death, we are alienated from nature and contribute to the degradation of the physical environment. We are also uncomfortable with our own bodies and don't like things that would normally be extraordinarily pleasurable, even sexual activity.\n\nA study by Dutch psychologists found that people who were reminded of their mortality liked forests more than neighborhoods, and that when reminded of their mortality in simulated games, they tempered their behavior in the service of maintaining a non renewable natural resource.\n\nHuman beings in Western society are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the desire for money and stuff. When reminded of their mortality, people say they want to have more money and to have more fancy, luxury items.\n\nPolish researchers found that people drew bigger coins and paper money after being reminded of their mortality, and that people who just got to count money reported having less death and anxiety.\n\nAmerica is currently a Petri dish of psychopathology. A third of the population is depressed, another third is addicted to drugs and alcohol, and the final third is watching survivor to see who could drink the most yak urine.\n\nThe American dream is highly unlikely to be achieved in the United States. If you embrace the American dream and you're 40 years old in a polyester suit selling three pound burritos on the second shift at the drive through at Taco Bell, well then that's your fault.\n\nI was the last generation of Americans where it was okay to be average, and I fear for the youth today because they are being held accountable for standards that are just not realistically attainable, and this is a recipe for psychological despair.\n\nI'm tempted to stop, but I don't want to leave you with that thought. Let's end on a more propitious note, by recognizing that human beings can use their ingenuity to reduce the destructive potential of their existential fears.\n\nIf Albert Camus's ideas about death are right, then we should all think about how our concerns about our mortality influence a lot of what we do.\n\nErik Erikson said that when parents have the courage to die, their children will have the faith to live, and I think that we can all contribute to making the world a better place.\n\nThe first study that we did with municipal court judges in Tucson, Arizona, was to see if death reminders would influence the punitive reactions of the judges. And sure enough, the bond was nine times higher when the judges were reminded of their mortality.\n\nLisa's silly joke: next time you get a parking ticket, pray that the judge hasn't driven past a cemetery on the way to sentencing you. There's been more than one study that shows that legal decisions are routinely altered by momentary conditions that include death reminders.\n\nWe should talk afterwards because we think there's other things going on and people aren't so sure when the psychological crap hits the fan.\n\nVera, an atheist, wants to know if religion has anything to do with death denial.\n\nBuddhists are good people, but in Burma, they treat others badly. Atheists are worse than agnostics, because they are convinced of things they can't know, and so they are just as vicious as their theistic counterparts.\n\nAtheists are just another death denying world view and a rather shallow and disenchanted one. When reminded of their mortality, atheists say they believe in God less, but unconsciously they become more religious just like religious people.\n\nWe are studying people who work in health care settings, like nurses, surgeons, and first responders, and we don't know yet if death reminders have predictable effects.\n\nWe haven't studied people who trend towards suicide, because we can't see a way to do that in an ethical fashion. We do have a chapter in our book about suicide that argues that most people who commit suicide believe that there is something better.\n\nMost primitive cultures, including shamanist and animist cultures, are tolerant of other religions, but they still see them as inferior to their own. This is because they see other religions as less than human.\n\nGood question, though, since you're saying that death anxiety is an inherent part of our humanity. Have you looked at children to see if their perspective is different than adults?\n\nWe have a chapter in our book on how children become aware of death. Some research suggests that children as young as nine hate Russian immigrants in Israel and love Jewish people.\n\nBy age 9, the effects that I spoke about tonight are already manifested in kids. But I don't know if the effects happen at the same time for all people, or if there's a developmental trajectory that can shed light on that.\n\nThere are studies that show that death reminders persist for hours or even days, but again, that doesn't answer your question. We're assaulted by a bouillabaisse of death-related imagery on a relatively regular basis.\n\nWe are doing research on how attitudes about abortion have been impacted by death anxiety. So far, we have found that Americans reminded of their mortality hate Muslims, object to a mosque being built in their neighborhood, and object to immigrants moving into their neighborhood.\n\nPeople don't seem to care about environmental issues, even after the Inconvenient Truth was released. They have a million excuses about why they aren't going to help the environment, and they don't want to take the blame.\n\nDeath anxiety is implicated in all of these issues, but it doesn't follow that it's the only factor. For example, conservatives are more willing to admit that global warming is real if it can be solved through market forces.\n\nI don't know if parents exhibit less fear anxiety than do non-parents, but I do know that when parents are reminded of their mortality, they say they want to have more kids, and they say they want to have them sooner.\n\nPeople who have had near death experiences report lower death anxiety, but when reminded of death, they become the most hateful of people who are different. So we are studying people who have had near death experiences, and measuring unconscious death anxiety.\n\nNear death experiences, we're looking at that now. There are a number of compelling examples of death reminders eliciting bad behavior, culminating in some current events regarding politics.\n\nWe're now trying to figure out if we can leverage some of the same psychological phenomenon to bring out the best in us, rather than just delineate the psychological underpinnings of the most unsavory characteristics of human behavior.\n\nWhen Lisa said that you didn't realize it, when you were five. My epiphany was when I was eight years old, and my grandmother died.\n\nWhen I first read Ernest Becker, I was like wow, this is actually what I've been dwelling on for all of my kid-hood. Jeff and I talk about how our terror-management theory has been our own form of death denial.\n\nShelden's book, The Worm at the Core, The Role of Death in Life, is about how death anxiety is affecting people today, and he invites you to come and join him for a book signing and a screening of the film Endless Abilities."

            "note_content": "#poetry \n\n\tDon’t try to understand life. Don’t try to understand love. Move into love. Then you will know—and that knowing will come out of your experiencing. That knowing will never destroy the mystery: the more you know, the more you know that much remains to be known.\n\t\n\tAnd that is the beauty of life—and the beauty of love. Love is mystery, and the more you know it, the more you are willing to be drowned in it. I am drowned in love. I am drowned in my own love. My love is such that it is ready to suffer, it is ready to cry, it is ready to laugh, it is ready to relish each and every moment of life.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tI am not saying that you should not be cautious. It is not a question of being cautious or not cautious. It is a question of being totally aware in each moment—whatever the moment demands. If the moment demands that I should be cautious, I should be cautious. If the moment demands that I should be daring, I should be daring. But it is my awareness that will decide and not my mind. My mind will not decide; my awareness will decide. And if my awareness decides, then whatsoever my decision, it will be right. If I decide out of mind, then I am bound to be in trouble.\n\t\n\tThis is what has happened to the world. People have decided out of the mind and they have created a world that is in deep trouble. The individual cannot be at ease; the society cannot be at ease; the whole world cannot be at ease. Everybody is in deep anxiety, in deep trouble. And this is so because you have decided out of the mind. You have decided to be cautious, and caution has become your philosophy.\n\t\n\tIt is not a matter of caution and no caution; it is a matter of being aware and not being aware. When you are very much aware, then you will move with the moment. Then you will not be in any problem.\n\t\n\tLife is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived and loved. Solving problems is for idiots, for those who don’t have any intelligence.\n\t\n\t“I am not a problem”\n\t\n\t“I don’t have to solve myself”\n\t\n\t“I have to allow myself to be free of problems.”\n\t\n\tBy allowing yourself to be free of problems, you have become intelligent. By allowing yourself to be free of problems, you have become aware. By becoming aware, you have become intelligent.\n\t\n\tSo what is the difference? The difference is very simple: in awareness, you do not know anything; in intelligence, you do not know anything. But in intelligence, you are enough. In awareness, you are not enough; you are too much. Something is missing in you.\n\t\n\tSo if you are intelligent, what is missing in you?\n\t\n\tYou are whole, you are complete.\n\t\n\tIf you are aware, you are complete, but something is missing.\n\t\n\tWhat is that?\n\nThe Witness.\n\nThis is where I find the Witness to be very important, because the Witness is what you are.\n\nWhen you are aware of something, you are complete, but when you are aware of the awareness, you are with the Witness.\n\nThis is why we say in Non-Duality, you are the Witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the awareness, you are complete, you are the Witness, you are God, you are the Absolute, you are the One, you are the Tao, you are the Self, you are the I AM, you are the Absolute.\n\nYou are not the observer, who is watching the mind. That is not you.\n\nThe observer is also a false identity, it is an object in the mind.\n\nIt is easy to mistake the observer for the Witness.\n\nBut the Witness is the awareness of the observer.\n\nThe observer is not the Witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the observer, you are the Witness.\n\nThe witness is not aware of the observer.\n\nThe observer is aware of the witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the witness, you are the observer.\n\nBut when you are aware of both the witness and the observer, you are neither.\n\nThe observer is a thought in the mind, the witness is being itself.\n\nThe observer and the witness are two distinct aspects of the same thing.\n\nThe observer is the seer and the witness is the seen.\n\nYet it is the same seer who sees himself when he witnesses.\n\nThus you are the observer, the witness and the seen.\n\nYou are the seer, the seen and the sight.\n\nYou are the perceiver, the perceived and the perception.\n\nYou are the knower, the known and the knowledge.\n\nThis is the secret of the triad.\n\n"

His most famous works are his Parallel Lives, a series of biographies of famous Greeks and Romans, and his Moralia, a collection of essays and writings on a variety of topics. Plutarch's works were influential in the development of moral philosophy and the revival of Stoic and Neoplatonic thought in the Renaissance. He is also seen as a major influence on the development of the Western philosophical tradition, particularly through his writings on justice and other virtues. Plutarch's themes revolve around the idea of virtue, both in the sense of moral excellence and of practical wisdom in understanding how to live a good life. He emphasizes the importance of making choices that lead to a life of virtue, and he exhorts readers to strive towards excellence in all aspects of their lives.\n\n\n![a lifelike linocut engraving of a singular president lula. red, black and white color scheme ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/198dfa2c-73ce-43f4-824d-be7df01af1db)\n\n"

An attempt to classify [[Bergson]]'s **philosophy** in either of these ways is hardly likely to be successful, since it cuts across all the recognized divisions.\n>\n>But there is another way of classifying **philosophies**, less precise, but perhaps more helpful to the non-**philosophical**; in this way, the principle of division is according to the predominant desire which has led the [[Philosopher]] to **philosophize**. Thus we shall have **philosophies** of feeling. inspired by the love of [[Happiness]]; theoretical **philosophies**, inspired by the love of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]; and practical **philosophies**, inspired by the love of action. \n>~ [[Russell]]\n\nPhilosophy is a sort of battle between the known and the unknown, between the adult and the child, the old and the new, the rational and the emotional, the revealer and the concealed, the conscious and the unconscious.\n\n# Love of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Skepticism]]\n\n### [[Empiricism]]\n\n### [[Rationalism]]\n\n## Unclassified\n\n### [[Idealism]]\n\n### [[Scholasticism]]\n\n# Love of [[Emotion]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Orphism]]\n\n### [[Bacchism]]\n\n### [[Epicureanism]]\n\n### [[Buddhism]]\n\n### [[Nihilism]]\n\n### [[Philosophy/Romanticism/Romanticism|Romantocism]]\n\n# Love of action \n#todo define action\n\n>Be a philosopher, but amidst your **philosophy**, be a man ~ [[Hume]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Stoicism]]\n\n### [[Confusianism]]\n\n### [[Taoism]]\n\n### [[Liberalism]]\n\n# Philosophy is the ultimate purpose of life\n\n\n>Without mus..**philosophy**, life would be a mistake ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>Of all people only those are at leisure who make time for **philosophy**, only those are really alive. For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs. All the years that have passed before them are added to their own. ~ [[Seneca]]\n\nUltimately, our inquiry of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is unlimited, we will likely never reach maximal [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], it is impossible, the universe will die before, [[Big crunch]].\nShould we jump off from this infinite treadmill that is the quest of the acquisition of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]? Or is it the purpose of life?\nIf then, the search for [[Compound Knowledge]] is the most fulfilling one, that is **philosophy**, [[Mathematic]], [[Physic]], [[Biology]].\n\n>To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that **philosophy**, in our age, can still do for those who study it. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n>My purpose is to exhibit **philosophy** as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n>**Philosophy** is not one of the natural [[Science|sciences]]. (The word '**philosophy**' must mean something which stands above or below, but not beside the natural [[Science|sciences]].) The object of **philosophy** is the logical clarification of thoughts. **Philosophy** is not a theory but an activity. A **philosophical** work consists essentially of elucidations. The result of **philosophy** is not a number of '**philosophical** propositions,' but to make propositions clear. **Philosophy** should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred ~ [[Wittgenstein]]\n\n**Philosophy** is [[Mathematic]] for words.\n\n>What a lot of trouble one avoids if one refuses to have anything to do with the common herd!

He maintained that material objects only exist through being perceived. To the objection that, in that case, a tree, for instance, would cease to exist if no one was looking at it, he replied that God always perceives everything; if there were no God, what we take to be material objects would have a jerky life, suddenly leaping into being when we look at them; but as it is, owing to God's perceptions, trees and rocks and stones have an existence as continuous as common sense supposes. This is, in his opinion, a weighty argument for the existence of God.\n\nActually, this way of thinking is used in computer graphics as an optimization technique called \"frustum culling\", objects, for an agent, only exists when perceived\n\n![[Pasted image 20210628084400.png]]\n\nCan we really deny the existence of what we don't perceive? I don't see infrared color but it exists?\n\n**Idealism** tend to derive into [[Nihilism]], [[Nietzsche]] said:\n>All the idealism of mankind, hitherto, is on the point of turning into Nihilism—may be shown to be a belief in absolute worthlessness, i.e. purposelessness\n\n[[Space]] and [[Physic/Time|time]] are an illusion?\n\n>I come now to a singular feature of Hegel's philosophy, which distinguishes it from the philosophy of Plato or Plotinus or Spinoza. Although ultimate reality is timeless, and time is merely an illusion generated by our inability to see the whole, yet the time-process has an intimate relation to the purely logical process of the dialectic. World history, in fact, has advanced through the categories, from Pure Being in China (of which Hegel knew nothing except that it was) to the Absolute Idea, which seems to have been nearly, if not quite, realized in the Prussian State. I cannot see any justification, on the basis of his own metaphysic, for the view that world history repeats the transitions of the dialectic, yet that is the thesis which he developed in his Philosophy of History. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n> La pathologie de l'idée est dans l'**idéalisme**, où l'idée occulte la réalité qu'elle a mission de traduire et se prend pour seule ~ [[Edgar Morin]]\n\n# Idealism is required to achieve [[Artificial general intelligence|AGI]]?\n\n**Idealism** helps us realize the limits of our [[Philosophy/Rationality/Intelligence|intelligence]]?

Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n- **Wealth** is money that earn while you sleep\n\n>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich. I’m not talking about the trickle-down effect here. I’m not saying that **if you let Henry Ford get rich, he’ll hire you as a waiter at his next party. I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your horse.**\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n>To put it another way: if **wealth** is giving you fewer options instead of more (and more varied) options, you’re doing it wrong. ~[[Nassim Taleb]]\n\n>A Man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep his Nose all his Life to the Grindstone, and die not worth a Groat at last. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\nBut most people increase their spending proportionally to their income?\n\n>Rather go to bed supperless, than in debt. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\nLive below your means.\n\n>If you wish to have leisure for your [[Mind|mind]], either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. ~ [[Seneca]]\n\nYou do not need to run the treadmill of money-making if you live as a poor man even though you have decent amount of money.\n\n>Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. ~ [[George Clason]]\n\n\n\n>But **wealth** had another advantage, too. Not only could it buy wives directly, it could also buy \"power.\" It is noteworthy that it is hard to distinguish between wealth and power before the time of the Renaissance. Until then there was no such thing as an power economic sector independent of the power structure. A man's livelihood and his allegiance were owed to the same social superior. Power is, roughly speaking, the ability to call do your bidding, and that depended strictly on wealth (with a little help from violence).\n>~ [[Biology/Matt Ridley|Ridley]]\n\n\n\n\n## Do not go into [[Entrepreneurship]] for **wealth**\n\n[[Entrepreneurship]] is not the best way to get wealth, or at least you will need a lot of patience. If you can wait a dozen of years, yes.\n\nBecause wealth is about being able to do nothing for months while still earning [[Money]].\n\nThere is many other reasons to go into [[Entrepreneurship]] though.\n\n\n## [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] beget **wealth**\n\n>The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner\n>~ [[Naval Ravikant]]\n\n## Why wealth is seen as \"bad\"\n\n>But since for most of the world’s history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Wealth is not a [[Zero Sum Game]]\n\n>Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient world because its citizens were the richest people of their time. They appreciated the value of money. They practiced sound financial principles in acquiring money, keeping money and making their money earn more money. They provided for themselves what we all desire . incomes for the future.\n>~ [[George Clason]]\n\nEveryone can be rich \n\n>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It’s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Origin\n\n>In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him.\n> ~ [[Adam Smith]]\n\n>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can’t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n### Comparative advantage\n\n![[Comparative Advantage]]\n\n## Wealth used to be evil\n\n>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Scientists and open sourcers are heroes donating wealth to society\n\n>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we’re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I’m running on the computer I’m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n\n\n## Links\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxGn2MBVdJI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

The other part is that neither farmers nor hunter-gatherers are naked, at least not figuratively. Farmers tend to breathe out nastier germs, to own better weapons and armor, to own more-powerful technology in general, and to live under centralized governments with literate elites better able to wage wars of conquest.

This fallacy is based on the idea that because the initial investment has already been made, it would be a waste to not continue investing in the same thing. It can lead people to ignore the actual value of the investment and make decisions based on the already invested amount instead of the potential returns.

It is an economic system that advocates for the collective ownership and control of the means of production and the equitable distribution of wealth and resources among all members of a society. Socialism also emphasizes social and economic justice, equal opportunity, and the elimination of social and economic inequality. It is a system that seeks to create a more equal and just society by redistributing wealth, providing universal access to basic services and goods, and eliminating poverty and inequality.\n\n\n\n\n![propaganda poster revolution communist millie bobby brown high detail year 1 9 4 4 russian letters lenin ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/14f42c53-6e93-4c30-8a09-98a07acc5a35)\n\n[[Nietzsche]] seems to argue that **socialism** is identical to Christianity, trying to tame the wild beast.\n\n![anthropomorphic furry wolf controlling an obscure machine that has been lost to time, 1900s photograph](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/01792c85-4a84-4587-9905-37d7293c57ed)\n\n[[Owen]] said, \"machinery, was displacing labour, and laisser-faire gave the working classes no adequate means of combating mechanical power\", leading to **socialism**.\n\n\n![a martian artifact in a museum, bronze, old, alien, verdigris, mechanical, gears ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/12c38c96-71e1-402a-865d-b82a46d87658)\n\nBut we're bound to replace our labour by machines #to-digest \n\n"

I want to avoid large groups though, as I strongly believe [[Conversation]]s do not scale.\n\nI like the idea of beta.spiel.com \"achieve [[Fractal]] locality for communities\".\n\nI really want to play with the [[Brain]]-extending features, but I really need to work on social side.\n\n#### 24-07-2021\n\nI am extremely busy, but hopefully a browser extension for **Langame** is coming soon.\n\n![[Drawing 2021-07-24 09.38.49.svg]]\n\nAh, and also **Langame** has been approved for OpenAI production 🎉.\n\n#### 26-07-2021\n\nearly browser extension\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-07-26 at 16.13.12.png]]\n\n#### 01-08-2021\n\nbrowser extension\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.29.07.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.54.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.46.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.26.png]]\n\n#### 17-08-2021\n\nActually, I love **Langame**, but I must transmit this love to others :), **RECRUIT YOUR FUCKING USERS** a la [[Paul Graham]].\n\nOn another thought, I thought about a business model, because getting money would help grow the project:\n- People can buy more tokens (to get **Langames**, i.e. conversation starters & more), it would be clearly disclaimed that when they buy tokens, it uses all the money to instantly generate some new **Langames**\n- It would be possible to have a subscription also to make things automatic, and ofc would use all the money to generate more **Langames**\n\n\nAnother thought, I am considering the possibility of open sourcing Langame, as the goal of this project is for humans, not for making money, maybe open source could grow the project better than private + more money/business? Really early idea though, not sure doable yet.\n\n>Without trade, innovation just does not happen. Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution. It stimulates novelty. ~ [[Biology/Matt Ridley]]\n\n#### 08-09-2021\n\nWow such delay. I have improved a few things, now **Langame** publish some thoughts automatically on https://twitter.com/langame_ai.\n\nI am very busy with another project of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], but hopefully can allocate some night and Sundays to:\n- second-brain related features\n- recruit users\n- keep improving **Langame** [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] models\n\nEspecially as I see the \"social app\" thing something that I don't want and is not [[Business/Entrepreneurship/Innovation]], these works already well:\n- https://gatheround.com/\n- https://www.donut.com/\n- https://lunchclub.com/\n- https://www.quizbreaker.com/\n\n[[Competition is for losers]].\n\n##### Next\n\n- **People can press to record themselves while conversing. The voice is turned to text. Later they can revisit their conversations, export it to obsidian.md, roamresearch.com or plain text**... I'd avoid recording other people imho?\n- **Let people generate starters and edit content / topics. Then all are checked manually and confirmed/edited or not**. Later will build a filtering model, when enough data and time, I've done this for another project, fine-tuning OpenAI for this kind of classification. I pretty much **like lesswrong.com collaborative system of tagging, upvoting etc**. It gives me some thoughts, thought I'm still very concerned about how to scale generation without lowering quality. Say, Bob the random guy watching football all day might not enjoy the same kind of conversations than John the philosopher.\n\n\n#### 09-09-2021\n\nhttps://blog.readwise.io/readwise-reading-app/\n\nsoon:\n- export conversations text to readwise \n- export conversation starters to readwise\n\n#### 10-09-2021\n\n**exports to readwise basically works now**.\nThough it could be more automated, i.e. connecting Langame account to readwise.\n\nnear future:\n- page to let **people generate [[Memetic|memes]]** and improve content / tag, then Langame team would check & confirm it, the users get rewarded (**Langame coins**) for providing high quality questions.\n- to scale up this, people could become **Langame** reviewers, plus of course several **fine tuned models for filtering quality**.\n\n#### 12-09-2021\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6p3s7M5fLRE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n#### 17-09-2021\n\n- Actively recruiting users, lesswrong.com might be an interesting hive.\n- New feature to record meme during Langames (speech to text), you then can digest them, export to readwise etc. ![[Pasted image 20210917100330.png|200x400]]\n- I need some ideas on how to integrate readwise/obsidian/roamresearch more closely with **Langame**, please send ideas :p louis.beaumont@langa.me\n- ![[Screenshot 2021-09-17 at 15.49.59.png]]\n- Will balance that a bit :p\n\n#### 18-09-2021\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FGdzDMfLBg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nsee: [[Baldwin effect]]\n\n#### 11-10-2021\n\n- registration soon (US company, probably Stripe Atlas), 2/3/4 cofounders\n- pivot to text only or text + audio (various reasons, it's easier to augment semi-asynchronous, non-real time conversations)\n- web version works well, might be publicly released, might be interesting\n- going back to the \"augmented conversation\" more than \"second brain\", we want to augment most people conversations, and eventually see if we can still manage to expand people knowledge\n- I'll go to silicon valley sooner or later (networking etc.), probably intermittently\n- soon co-founding https://www.linkedin.com/company/inkdrop-ai too. I am transparent with my co-founders, I strongly believe I can do both, I'm quite good at time management, focusing and [[Deep work]]\n\n# Ideas\n- let people throw an idea, a quote (readwise.io), something into a box, it create a convenient starter based on it -> **MORE COLLABORATIVE FEATURES**\n- adjust starters/topics/app to **people personality**\n- exporting audio also? (instead of speech to text)\n- connect plenty of apps (**twitter share Memes, Readwise, Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Youtube?**) tighter than the native share thing which adds friction\n- With the slow transition from big physical computers, human-machine interfaces, to [[Brain Computer Interfaces]], currently, earbuds (Apple launched it as always), we could give **conversation feedbacks into people ear** as audio (\"you should be nicer\", \"try to ask this, that...\")\n\n-->\n\n%%"

Why aren't you spending more time around them?\n    \n-   What would you immediately stop doing if others didn't expect it of you?

However interdependent we are on each other, we are using each other for a purpose, for an end. With an end in view, relationship is not. You may use me and I may use you.

The end, the gain, prevents relationship, communion. In the usage of another, however gratifying and comforting it may be, there is always fear. To avoid this fear, we must possess.

It is actively choosing to be kind and understanding when it is more difficult to do so. It is about being selfless and doing what you can to make someone else’s life easier or better without expecting anything in return. Radical kindness is about being kind to strangers, even when it might be uncomfortable, or going out of your way to help someone you know.

It is about recognizing that we are all connected and that the kind deeds we do for others will come back around to bless us in some way.

In microeconomics, they try to characterize it this way: The principal’s incentives are different than the agent’s incentives, so the owner of the business wants what is best for the business and will make the most money. The agent generally wants whatever will look good to the principal, or might make them the most friends in the neighborhood or in the business, or might make them personally the most money. \n>\n>You see this a lot with hired-gun CEOs running public companies, where the ownership of the public company is distributed so widely that there’s no principal remaining. Nobody owns more than 1% of the company. The CEO takes charge, stuffs the board with their buddies and then starts issuing themselves low-priced stock options, or doing a lot of stock buybacks because their compensation is based directly tied to the stock price.\n>~ [[Naval Ravikant]]\n\n[[Marx]] stressed that the employer purchases the worker's time on the labour market, not the worker's work. In companies the employees are not paid by the value they bring which creates a misalignment between employee and employer.\n\n>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\nI talked to arweave.org core team, they'd turn the agents into principals by letting them act as founder\n\nAlso, scale tend to increase the gap between agent and principal, in large companies for example.\n\n# External\n\nhttps://nav.al/principal-agent"

However, this behavior can be detrimental if taken too far and can lead to difficult situations.

According to the archaeological evidence discussed in Chapter 1, humans entered the Americas at Alaska only around 12,000 B.C., spread south of the Canadian ice sheets as Clovis hunters a few centuries before 11,000 B.C., and reached the southern tip of South America by 10,000 B.C. Even if the dis puted claims of older human occupation sites in the Americas prove valid, those postulated pre-Clovis inhabitants remained for unknown reasons very sparsely distributed and did not launch a Pleistocene proliferation of hunter-gatherer societies with expanding populations, technology, and art as in the Old World. Food production was already arising in the Fertile Crescent only 1,500 s after the time when Clovis-derived hunter-gatherers years were just reaching southern South America.\n>~ [[Jared Diamond]]\n\n#to-digest \n# External links"

This type of market relies on the laws of supply and demand, allowing prices to be determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers. In a free market, businesses have the freedom to produce whatever goods and services they choose, and buyers have the freedom to purchase whatever goods and services they want. This system allows for a more efficient allocation of resources and encourages competition, which can lead to lower prices, higher quality goods and services, and increased innovation.\n\n\n>The message from history is so blatantly obvious – that free trade causes mutual prosperity while protectionism causes poverty – that it seems incredible that anybody ever thinks otherwise.\n>~ [[Biology/Matt Ridley|Ridley]]\n\nI.e.

This strategy involves cooperating with the other person at first, and then mirroring their moves. This type of approach is likely to result in a win-win outcome, as both parties will recognize that they can benefit from cooperating. By using a positive and playful voice, you are showing your willingness to work together and engender trust. This trust is a crucial part of successful negotiations and can lead to solutions that both parties are happy with.\n\n\n## The Bully\n\n>The Bully (aka UAW Negotiator)  \n>The bully negotiates by yelling and screaming, forcing issues, and threatening the other party. Most folks who are bullies aren't the smart and don't really understand the issues; rather, they try to win by force. There are two ways to deal with bullies: punch them in the nose or mellow out so much that you sap their strength. If you can outbully the bully, go for it. But if you are wrong, then you've ignited a volcano. Unlike on the children's playground, getting hit by a bully during a negotiation generally doesn't hurt; so unless this is your natural ne gotiating style, our advice is to chill out as your adversary gets hotter.\n\n## The Technocrat\n\n>The Technocrat (aka Pocket Protector Person)  \n>This is the technical nerd. Although they won't yell at you like the bully and you don't wonder if there is a real human being behind the facade like you do with the nice guy, you will feel like you are in endless detail hell. The technocrat has a billion issues and has a hard time deciding what's really important, since to them everything is important for some reason. Our advice is to grin and bear it and perhaps play Fortnite while you are listening to the other side drag on. Technocrats tend to cause you to lose your focus during the ne- gotiation. Make sure you don't by remembering what you care about and conceding the other points. But make sure you cover all the points together, as the technocrat will often negotiate every point from scratch, not taking into consideration the give-and-take of each side during the negotiation. Sometimes this role is simply that: a role. Many folks have endless energy for this stuff and will use this tactic to simply tire you out during the negotiation.\n\n## The Nice Gay\n\n>The Nice Gay (aka Used-Car Salesman)  \n>Whenever you interact with this pleasant person, you feel like they are trying to sell you something. Often, you aren't sure that you want what they are selling. When you say no, the nice guy will either be openly disappointed or will keep on smiling at you just like the audi ence at a Tony Robbins event. In their world, life is great as long as you acquiesce to their terms (or buy this clean 2010 Chrysler Sebring). As the negotiation unfolds, the nice guy is increasingly hard to pin down on anything. While the car salesman always needs to go to their manager, the nice-guy negotiator regularly responds with talk \"Let me consider that and get back to you.\" While the nice guy doesn't yell at you like the bully, it's often frustrating that you can\n\n## The Wimp\n\n>The Wimp (aka George McFly)  \n>The wimp may sound like the perfect dance partner here, but they have their own issues. Our bet is that you can take their wallet pretty easily during the negotiation, but if you get too good a deal it will come back to haunt you. And then you get to live with them on your board of directors once you close your financing. With the wimp, you end up negotiating both sides of the deal. Sometimes this is harder than having a real adversary.\n\n## Smooth, Steady, and Smart\n\n>Smooth, Steady, and Smart (aka Diane Lockhart from The Good Fight)  \n>The last of the personalities is the person who really has it all. This per son can shape-shift into one or more of the personas we mentioned but has a natural calm brilliance that makes for a strong adversary. This person spends the right amount of time preparing, knows all the points at play, and has done their homework on you. They are so confident of their work product that they ooze a legitimate calm like they are walking in a park. If you've done your homework, the two of you probably will engender immediate respect and sometimes even trust. This is the best of all worlds and truly leads to a win-win out- come. On the other hand, if you haven't done your homework, they will steamroll you while making you feel good about it. Later on, that evening, you will feel differently as you commiserate with yourself over your favorite adult beverage.\n\n>You should never make an offer first. There's no reason to, unless you have another concrete one on the table. Why run the risk of aiming too low?\n\n\n>~ [[Brad Feld - Venture Deals Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist]]"

Love is a journey that never ends, a continuous cycle of giving and receiving. It is the foundation of all relationships, both romantic and platonic.

You fall in love.  \n  >\n>Then after a few days you start going deeper into the woman. You start loving her heart. Now a far more beautiful revelation is coming to you.

Then it is not only her heart - now that has become secondary. Now it is the very person, the very presence, the very radiance, the aliveness, that unknown phenomenon of her being - that she is.

Now she is not just a representative of woman, she is also a representative of man as much. The sky is becoming bigger and bigger. Then one day it is not humanity, but existence. That she exists, that's all that you want - that she exists. You are coming very close to God.  \n  >\n>Then the last point comes - all formulations and all forms disappear and there is God.

He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power. He can, however, promise those actions that are usually the consequence of love, hatred, or faithfulness, but that can also spring from other motives: for there are several paths and motives to an action. A promise to love someone forever, then, means, ‘As long as I love you I will render unto you the actions of love; if I no longer love you, you will continue to receive the same actions from me, if for other motives.’ Thus the illusion remains in the minds of one’s fellow men that the love is unchanged and still the same.\n>One is promising that the semblance of love will endure, then, when without self-deception one vows everlasting love.\n>~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.\n>~ [[A History Of Western Philosophy - Russell, Bertrand|Russell -  Bertrand]]\n## Scholar answer\n\n### Psychology\n\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n>Rank could conclude that the love relationship of modern man is a religious problem.\n\n>We turn to the love partner for the experience of the heroic, for perfect validation; we expect them to “make us good” through love.\n\n>When we say that sex and death are twins, we understand it on at least two levels. The first level is philosophical-biological. Animals who procreate, die. Their relatively short life span is somehow connected with their procreation. Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to procreate.\n\n>Is one oppressed by the burden of his life? Then he can lay it at his divine partner’s feet. Is self-consciousness too painful, the sense of being a separate individual, trying to make some kind of meaning out of who one is, what life is, and the like? Then one can wipe it away in the emotional yielding to the partner, forget oneself in the delirium of sex, and still be marvellously quickened in the experience.\n\n>It seems to be difficult for the individual to realize that there exists a division between one’s spiritual and purely human needs, and that the satisfaction or fulfillment for each has to be found in different spheres. As a rule, we find the two aspects hopelessly confused in modern relationships, where one person is made the godlike judge over good and bad in the other person. In the long run, such symbiotic relationship becomes demoralizing to both parties, for it is just as unbearable to be God as it is to remain an utter slave.\n\n## rnd\n\n>Romantics value intensity over stability.

All of the\n\tprincesses end up with a dashing prince, whom they barley know and have only met once\n\tor twice. No information is given on how their romantic relationships are formed and/or\n\tmaintained. All of them fall in love, get married, and somehow live happily ever after\n\t(Tanner, Haddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). This also sends the message that when\n\ta man and woman meet, they instantaneously fall in love. No time is needed to elapse\n\tand no other common factors need to be in place in order for love to form (Tanner,\n\tHaddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). These three princesses fear ending up alone and\n\teven fantasize about the day they’ll meet their prince. They all sing about the possibility\n\tof falling in love and finding immediate happiness. Their entire narrative as a character\n\tis to find a happy ending through romance (Whelan, 2012).\n\t\n\tAll three of the princesses are also saved by their male counterparts. Snow White\n\tand Aurora are both placed in a deathly coma. Their very lives depend on their prince\n\tfinding and rescuing them with true love’s kiss. Cinderella’s life didn’t depend on her\n\tfalling in love, but her livelihood was dependent on being saved by the prince from \u0000\n\t16\n\tenslavement (Junn, 1997; Whelan, 2012). The first era of princesses also engaged in\n\tmore love-related behaviors than their male counterparts, such as making their desire for\n\tromance known. References to marriage and weddings were also highly common\n\tthroughout the three movies (Junn, 1997).\n\t\n\tThe emphasis for the second era of princesses is placed on ending up with a suitor\n\twhom the princess loves. They want to choose the right partner and still be able to fulfill\n\ttheir dreams (Whelan, 2012). The films from the second era actually refer to love 2.5\n\ttimes more than the first era. Jasmine, for example, rebels against her arranged marriage\n\tand focuses on pursuing Aladdin because she falls in love with him (Junn, 1997). The\n\tideas of marriage and weddings decreased as compared to the first era, which shows\n\timprovement because marriage is not their only end game. Mulan, for example, does not\n\tmarry her love interest and instead decides to pursue a dating relationship (Tanner,\n\tHaddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). Pocahontas breaks this stereotype even more\n\tbecause her romantic relationship completely dissolves. She instead chooses the love of\n\ther family and stays behind with them (Aidman, 1999). Love also gets represented as\n\tsomething that forms over time, especially in Mulan and Beauty and the Beast which\n\tshows progress in how love is portrayed (Tanner, Haddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003).\n\tAlthough the second era of princesses do break some of the traditional stereotypes\n\tconcerning romance, their ultimate goal still remains to find a suitable partner for\n\tmarriage (Do Rozario, 2004). This is present in Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The\n\tLittle Mermaid. Mulan does not marry her suitor in the end, but she does give up her\n\ttomboyish identity to enter a relationship with Shang. The film also alludes to the fact\n\tthat they will enter a romantic relationship that will most likely lead to marriage. Love \u0000\n\t17\n\tand marriage serve as a way to tame and domesticate these rebellious women by having\n\tthem settle down (Whelan, 2012). Their happily ever after still seems to be dependent on\n\tfinding a man (Junn, 1997). Pocahontas, as briefly mentioned earlier, does not adhere to\n\tthis stereotype. However, the interpretation of her story is completely distorted and\n\thistorically inaccurate. Pocahontas never had a romantic relationship with John Smith\n\tand eventually does leave her family to marry and move to England. Therefore, one\n\tcould argue that the historical facts reflect stereotypical portrayals of love (Superhuman4,\n\t2015).\n\t\n\tWomen’s attractiveness to men is also more apparent in this era when it comes to\n\tfinding a suitable mate. Compared to the first era, these films show 7.5 times more\n\tsexually related depictions of women. The princesses engaged in more sexually\n\tprovocative stances to try and attract a partner, such as striking certain poses and\n\tprimping themselves before seeing their prince (Junn, 1997). These princesses are\n\tdepicted as highly attractive and more voluptuous with bigger busts (Junn, 1997).\n\tIn the first and second era, the princesses are shown as having to abandon their\n\town desires in order to pursue marriage (Lee, 2008). They often have to overcome\n\tparental demands or leave their families and homes in order to marry and get their\n\thappily ever after. The princes, however, did not have external factors preventing them\n\tfrom marrying the woman of their choosing. They could choose their partners as they\n\tpleased and their happiness was not dependent on finding love, but simply a benefit (Lee,\n\t2008). This shows how romance and the princesses happily ever afters are still\n\tdependent on finding a romantic suitor, even if they choose not to pursue marriage\n\t(Whelan, 2012). \n\n---\n\n\tThe Disney princess films important cultural artifacts when one considers the gender stereotypes, particularly roles of women, over the course of the last seventy years. I argue that the princesses in each of these films are positive role models of women who have slowly yet effectively challenged the gender restrictions of the past while advocating for equality and ultimate success for women. Snow White resembles the flapper and hardworking attitude necessary in the 1930s, Cinderella maintains a positive attitude for self-preservation, Pocahontas pushes societal expectations to advocate for herself, Merida refuses to conform to traditional expectations, and Anna and Elsa are strong confident women who are not afraid of success. Looking at the relationships between the princesses and the animals is important as these creatures serve as a crucial piece of evidence to the positive messages that viewers may deduce from the pieces. The animals highlight the strength, determination, spunk, and perseverance of the women in these pieces by advocating for their respective protagonist. Society has evolved to the point that these figures are no longer necessary and I predict that strong figures will continue to appear in Disney productions. This research is important to consider when one considers the Disney princesses as positive role models for women. As I have Page | 34 evaluated, there is much evidence to indicate they are progressive images of women should be appreciated by modern audiences.[^2]\n\n\n[^1]: https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=edspec201019\n[^2]: https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=uhp_theses"

Each love language has a unique way of expressing and receiving love, and it is important to recognize each one. Words of affirmation are verbal expressions of love, such as compliments and encouraging words. Acts of service are small acts that show you care, such as doing the dishes or running an errand. Physical touch is any act of physical affection, such as holding hands or giving a hug. Quality time is dedicated time spent together, such as going on a date or taking a walk. Receiving gifts is any tangible item that shows appreciation, such as a bouquet of flowers or a box of chocolates.

Can’t the human brain adapt to new social structures?  \nShould we build software that respects a fractal model, i.e., that keeps the size of local groups below a certain number?  \nIn my experience, conversations don’t scale, i.e. the best conversations have less than 4 members.  \nDoesn’t this make sense, as each individual has different goals, model of the world, and personalities, so that personalities multiply rather than add up, it doesn’t scale?\n\nWhere do you see fractal patterns in communities, in politics, in social networks?  \nDoes the disrespect of this pattern harm social interactions?\n\n```\nHi @louis1, this is an interesting topic, thank you for bringing it in!\n\nTo me, Dunbar’s number is not a figure, it is a concept: there is a limit to our social networks, to how many nodes our attention can process in parallel. 150 may indicate the magnitude of this limit, although there is no reason to consider this number in particular. If we consider a population and the Dunbar’s limit for each individual, we’ll obviously look at a distribution. Skills or conditions may affect this limit (e.g. sales representatives or physicians may have greater limits, or some form of autism may reduce it).\n\nNow, the fractal aspect is interesting. Considering your example about number of participants beyond which a conversation’s quality would suffer. Could we transpose this at higher scale?  \nDoes it apply to the number of teams that can collaborate together at once within an organization? To the number of organizations that can collaborate together within a society? To the number of societies on a planet? To the number of planets in a solar system, or beyond and up to universes?  \nI do not have answers, although I am interested to read thoughts from the Farnam Street Learning Community!\n```\n\n# 240922\n\nThat’s an interesting connection to “company culture”, I also see it as shared knowledge across different scales\n\n![[Pasted image 20220812142330.png]]\n\n\nWhen a problem occurs in a group, you want every member to pick similar solutions in the solution space.\n\nI don’t have a lot of experience in maintaining culture in a group, but in my company we try to put actions in place for that, because actions seem to be a better way to maintain culture than words.  \nFor example, we believe in transparency/honesty, so every month we have to give 5 praises and one critique to each other one-to-one.\n\nI’m not sure how different scales differ, maybe there is a more or less linearity though?\n\n![[Pasted image 20220924093215.png]]\n\n### Related interested links\n\n-   Conversations: [Celeste Headlee: The Dying Art of Conversation](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/celeste-headlee/)\n-   Common knowledge at different scales: [Shtetl-Optimized » Blog Archive » Common Knowledge and Aumann’s Agreement Theorem](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2410)\n-   Common knowledge at different scales: [The Costly Coordination Mechanism of Common Knowledge - LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge#Startups)\n\n# External links\n\n"

Dunbar's number implies that humans are still limited in how many meaningful relationships they can maintain, and that it is impossible to maintain genuine relationships with an infinite number of people. This is not to say that social media sites cannot be used to form meaningful connections, but that there is a limit to how many of these connections an individual can maintain\n\n\n\n![a cybernetic symbiosis of a single engineer astronaut mech-organic eva suit made of pearlescent wearing knitted shiny ceramic multi colored yarn thread infected with diamond 3d fractal lace iridescent bubble 3d skin dotted covered with orb stalks of insectoid compound eye camera lenses floats through the living room, film still from the movie directed by Denis Villeneuve with art direction by Salvador Dalí, wide lens,kevlar,carbon fiber,ceramics,gaseous materials,](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0a210b4c-f330-4221-98c6-47dac4c35041)\n\n\n>Of course, at the Village stage, the company likely exceeds **Dunbar’s number** (the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships), and the founder simply won’t have time to meet one on one with every employee with any reasonable frequency\n>~ [[Reid Hoffman - Reid Hoffman - Blitzscaling - The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies - libgen.li|Reid Hoffman]].\n\n\nDunbar's number is a concept that suggests that the human mind is limited in its capacity to keep up with the exponential growth of technology. As technology advances, the number of relationships and connections that a person is able to maintain also increases, leading to potential social and cognitive overload. The concept of Dunbar's number raises concerns about the human ability to manage these increased levels of connectivity and the potential for an overall decrease in the quality of human relationships. It is an important issue to consider in the midst of a rapidly changing technological landscape, as it is necessary to maintain a balance between using technology in a way that enriches our lives and avoiding the potential for negative consequences on both our personal and professional relationships.\n\n\n![distorted perspective extremely detailed movie still of a distorted mirror maze by denis villenueve, ultra wide angle, trippy, wavy, 4 d ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/034ea5f4-0a7f-43f1-8092-5a7a1eba25e2)\n\n"

We must have the radio or books or talking, incessant chatter about this and that, about art and culture. So we come to that point when we know there is this extraordinary sense of selfisolation. We may have a very good job, work furiously, write books, but inwardly there is this tremendous vacuum. We want to fill that and dependence is one of the ways. We use dependence, amusement, church work, religions, drink, women, a dozen things to fill it up.\n>~ [[Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\n\n\n\n\n![motherhood, concept art, dramatic lighting, blunt borders, rule of thirds ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0a698898-4b86-41a7-8d87-f33b3611df65)\n\n\n\n\n\n>When insecurity creeps into dependency, as it inevitably does, then that particular relationship is cast aside and a new one taken on in the hope of finding lasting security; but there is no security in relationship, and dependency only breeds fear. Without understanding the process of security and fear, relationship becomes a binding hindrance, a way of ignorance. Then all existence is struggle and pain, and there is no way out of it save in right thinking, which comes through self-knowledge.\n>~ [[Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\n\n![painting of hybrid between elephant & butterfly!!, intercrossed animal, mixture animal, by tiffany bozic, by zdzislaw beksinski, by vladimir kush, surrealism, cold hue's, warm tone gradient background, concept art, beautiful composition, digital painting, ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/08a02412-9296-4d4a-b188-6d1e06d5d1fa)\n\n\n>Without someone to lean on, to give them a sense of comfort and security, they feel lonely.

I believe in something, or I hold on to an ideal, and that gives me great comfort; but remove the ideal, remove the belief, and I am lost. It is the same thing with a guru. I depend because I want to receive, so there is the ache of fear. Again, it is the same when you depend on your parents or teachers. It is natural and right that you should do so when you are young; but if you keep on depending when you have grown to maturity, that will make you incapable of thinking, of being free.

The female needs to know the truth about the male: his health, wealth, and genes. The male wants to exaggerate the [[Information|information]]. The female wants the truth; the male wants to lie. The very word seduction implies trickery and manipulation. ~ [[Matt Ridley]]\n\n\nhttps://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/the-9-archetypal-lovers-you-are-attracted-to\n\n## 1. The Siren\n\nThe Siren is of highly charged traditionally-feminine energy and tends to attract those of a completely opposite, traditionally-masculine energy. Whether or not you identify as male, female or neither, you'll tend to be attracted to a Siren when you show characters on the extremes of traditionally-male behaviour.\n\n————————\n\n_*NOTE*_\n\n_I absolutely hate using the words feminine and masculine because of the connotations behind each. When we think feminine, we think of the female sex, and when we think of masculine, we think of the male sex. However, feminine and masculine or just two ends of a behavioural spectrum, regardless of sex or gender. Just know that from now on, do not envision a traditional-female figure when I say feminine/female, and do not envision a traditional-male figure when I say masculine/male. Whatever you identify as, you hold both male and female behaviours and energy._\n\n————————\n\nFor example, when you show rigidity, high responsibility, almost a coldness and the need for control in things, the Siren is your opposite. The Siren plays on society's oppression of your inner desire for personal pleasure and play, most notably through your senses.\n\nThink Cleopatra and Marilyn Monroe. These Sirens were attractive because of their ability to bring out a heightened masculine feeling in those they came in contact with. Cleopatra brought exoticism and a sense of godly masculinity to both Julius Ceasar and Mark Antony (and probably many others), and Marilyn Monroe brought a sense of masculine danger and pleasure to Joe DiMaggio and John F Kennedy  (and probably many others).\n\n We're attracted to, and actively try to attract, Sirens when we secretly just want to let go. When society needs us to be a strong rock, an emotionless stoic with many a responsibility, the Siren attracts us with their lure of opposing behaviour we desperately long for.\n\nThink back to your past crushes. Were you attracted to them because they made you feel extra masculine? Did they dangle a life of ease and little responsibility in your strict day-to-day affairs?\n\nThe trouble with Sirens is their ability to bring out laziness for short-term pleasure.  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Siren:**\n\n1.  Do not let your character suffer.\n    \n2.  Keep an open understanding of what you plan to do with your life.\n    \n3.  Never forget your life plan and do not let yourself be distracted for minimal pleasure.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 2. The Rake\n\nThe Rake is characterized as the masculine Siren. Playing on society's roles that a female character must abide by, the Rake brings out the oppressed behaviours of a traditionally-femine figure. They bring out the excited feminine in us. Again, male, female, or neutral, we're attracted to Rakes when we've been too confined and comfortable - too restrained - too neutral and unenergized in our day-to-day lives. \n\nFor example, when we've grown accustomed to the office banter, the politically correct and neutral acceptance of things and our banal schedules, the Rake stirs things up and makes us feel special. The Rake is guided by his enflamed passion for you at the expense of others, and gives you the thrill of hot romance. Like the Siren, they strive to help you let go of responsibilities in favour of in-the-moment pleasure. No talk of future responsibilities.\n\nWhere the Siren attracts with visual sensuality, the Rake attracts with linguistic sensuality. The Rake is a master of language, communicative influence, and poetic verbiage. Often times, we may know we aren't going anywhere mature with a Rake, but that's what makes them so attractive. They are the heat of the moment and give us some texture in our  dull lives. They could pull a casanova and hide in a closet until you're alone for the pleasurable taking. \n\nThink Don Juan (or JGL's Don Jon), Christian Grey, or Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl. They'll say and do anything to get us to fall for them, and they're able to do so because we've been so bored. Again, the majority of their attractiveness comes from their words, but it is the colourful and dangerous imagery they paint in our minds that become our daydreams.\n\nThe trouble with Rakes is their tendency to over-exaggerate their love and insinuate improbable fantasies of lasting partnership.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Rake:**\n\n1.  Do not let your character suffer.\n    \n2.  Let them know of your life plans, and hold them accountable if they hold you back.\n    \n3.  Do not let yourself be hypnotized by their current words of pleasure. Keep track of their actions.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents. \n    \n\n---\n\n## 3. The Ideal Lover\n\n The Ideal Lover comes to us from our childhood dreams, or rather our lost dreams. They are the ones that bring a hopeless fantasy to life with their ability to mirror the ideals we once had as  innocent happy-go-lucky children, but have lost to grey world. They are highly astute at understanding our deepest desires and definitions of affection and bring them to fruition.\n\nWhatever it may be, the Ideal Lover takes [the time to fully understand you and empathize with you](https://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/10-books-every-power-couple-needs-to-read). They play the long game. They study you and question you while giving you a sense of affectionate attention. And then they'll play your deepest desires to their advantage, accentuating the ideals you long for. They either show your desired ideals in themselves, or they try to make those ideals appear in you. \n\nWhen this happens, we're hooked. We see a filling of a forgotten desire in them, with them, and through them. Often a chivalrous knight or a motherly damsel, or something completely different, they come to the rescue out of nowhere with a romanticized but real idea of love. \n\nThink Casanova, and John F Kennedy. Kennedy notably took the helm of a nation longing for lost ideals and future hope -- the epitome of the Ideal Lover. Tony Robbins does this with his clients, Gary Vaynerchuk with his entrepreneurial following, and Andy Warhol with his artistic subjects -- they were always painted in the most hopeful light. The trick of the Ideal Lover is their ability to know what \"hope\" looks like to different people. \n\nOn the other hand, the trouble with Ideal Lovers is their grandiose self-image and lack of ability to operate within the realms of reality. Their high ideals are the culprit of this, and if left unchecked, can get too out of hand.\n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with an Ideal Lover:**\n\n1.  Allow for their hope and ideas of growth, but also keep a firm grounding on reality.\n    \n2.  Keep open communication for your life plans.\n    \n3.  Remember they are only human and are not godlike myths - be cautious with their proposals and plans.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Dandy\n\nThe Dandy is the Siren or the Rake of the same sex. They attract the traditionally-male with psychologically masculine traits, and they attract the traditionally-female with psychologically feminine traits. They tear down the labels that society has put on sexuality and they play in all spaces. We're attracted to Dandies for their ambiguous and obscure personas, and their freedom to break prejudice sexual behavioural roles.\n\nSince humans are a social creature, our societies will always tend towards a general acceptance of values in order to keep everyone in place. Dandies defy this and let themselves explore multiple perspectives, especially those perspectives that are not accepted by society. \n\nOften mysterious and unable to predict, Dandies spark our interest when we have repressed desires for freedom. Their lack of conformity to the masses is such an attractive characteristic that we all want a piece of. The fact that they easily flaunt it -- whether through their clothing, opinions, or overall behaviour -- is something to be jealous of in itself. Why not try to obtain this freedom for ourselves? \n\nFlamboyant males and rigid females are the popular images that come to mind. Think Rudolph Valentino and Lou Andreas-Salomé. The masculine Dandy and the feminine Dandy. They cast spells on the opposite gender using their same behaviours. Valentino had a very feminine-described etiquette and appearance, and Salomé had very rigid independent habits. They attracted their lovers by showing how free they were to act like their lovers.\n\nAs progressive as these types sound, their strong ability to relate to you could also lead to troubles. Power struggles may be an issue since you'd most likely be sharing similar fields of work or goals. Another is the inevitable case of [unconditional acceptance -- we come to expect them to understand us fully without even speaking, and can only lead to miscommunication.](https://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/the-secret-to-mature-and-accepting-relationships)\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Dandy:**\n\n1.  Take inspiration from their free-spiritedness, but do not forget your responsibilities and the others you need.\n    \n2.  As you share similar fields of interest, do not deliberately try to outshine each other. It's not a competition.\n    \n3.  Do not let yourself be swayed by their indifference or unconcern for others. Always treat others respectfully.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 5. The Natural\n\nThe Natural is a reflection of those golden years of comfort and innocent affection - childhood. They portray what both Kubrick and Freud would describe as 'uncanny'. Familiar yet strange. The Natural brings into their persona a sense of youthfulness in an adult body, drawing those that long for the times of no responsibilities, harmlessness, and naive spontaneity.  \n\nWe miss those times and the Natural brings it back to us. Their child-like mannerisms and kind of weakness is something that attracts us. They draw out sympathy in us through their subconscious actions of needing protection. They probably won't say it outright or explicitly ask you for motherly/fatherly-ness, but it's their openness for affection and protection that draws us so close and dear.\n\nThey represent a world we've all left behind, and to some, we see this as a doorway back to that playroom. The Natural mainly draws upon 4 characteristics that we are attracted to: innocence, blissful unawareness, spontaneous talent/skill, or openness. All 4 are key indicators of a Natural and can seem endearing to be around.\n\nThink Charlie Chaplin, Paul McCartney, Lil Yachty, Ryan Reynolds. They all emit this aura of youth that falls on us with an almost intoxicating feeling. A self awareness and openness in their sincerity. They don't even try to act like the other adults. While everyone hits us with a seriousness and strict adulthood-ness, it's the Natural people that calm our senses and ease our anxieties of needing to be an overly cautious grownup. Because if they can succeed this far as a child, why can't we?\n\nThe common obstacle while dealing with Naturals is their tendency to be too childish. Their innocence and naiveté can easily turn into irritation as you start to feel too much like a parent. When you can't talk to them on an equal level and start to baby them, a sense of annoyance and irritability may start to arise.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Natural:**\n\n1.  Treat life with a light heart, but keep yourselves aware of your responsibilities as growing individuals.\n    \n2.  Do not take the role of mother/father and child. Set your boundaries and expectations for one another.\n    \n3.  Find \"adult things\" to do and enjoy together. Don't rely on childhood memories to bring joy.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 6. The Coquette\n\nThe Coquette is hot and cold. They touch and go. They attract you with hopeful words or sensual maneuvers and then step back and distance themselves from you. They entice you and frustrate you at the same time, and we're attracted to this because of our human nature to want what we can't have.\n\nThey tease us. This may seem like an obvious unattractive trait, but the reason they spark any sort of infatuation is because of their ability to plant a seed of desire in our minds that continues to grow without them needing to be there. Consciously or subconsciously, they've come to understand what we desire, and insinuate that they are the solution to our desires -- all without being present.\n\nThey are the ultimate tease because it is in their psychological enchantment that takes hold of our A) hoping for their surrender to us, and B) the thought that we can be just as independent. With the former, it is so common for both men and women to fawn over people they know they can't have or know they shouldn't have  -- the grass is always greener on the other side. With the latter, much like the Dandy, we want to be in the presence of someone just as carefree and unworried about the consequences of their actions -- and the Coquette does just that, showing little acknowledgement for us and giving hope that maybe we can have little worry for consequence as well.\n\nThink Josephine de Beauharnais, John Mayer, Ginger from Casino, and every bachelor on The Bachelor. They dangle the love carrot on a stick in front of us, but never fully give it to us. They use the virtue of delayed satisfaction to their advantage. And this is exciting to us because we know how independent they are, but there's just that bit of hope that they could be dependent on us. And that satisfies both our human need for wanting what we can't have _and_ our human need to feel significantly special. Coquettes are like a shadow we cannot grasp but are always lingering behind us.  \n\nThe obvious downside is their unreliability. They may show bouts of deep affection and loyalty to us (which gives us some of the biggest excitements and joys we can feel), but on the whole they are difficult to tame and keep within our needs.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Coquette:**\n\n1.  Set the expectations. Right from the start. If you're willing to play hot and cold, let them know and let yourself know.\n    \n2.  Do not fall for their words or small acts of compassion -- keep a general tally of how reliable they act\n    \n3.  Keep a firm grasp of your needs and never settle.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n##  7. The Charmer\n\nThe Charmer has almost a devilish smile you're willing to swoon over. The word \"charm\" comes from the Latin \"carmen\" -- a song or a chant that is synonymous with a magic spell. To charm is to literally cast a spell on another. The way that they do this, and the reasons we fall for them, is because they understand 3 fundamental laws of human nature: The law of narcissism, the law of defensiveness, and the law of grandiosity. It's our egos that they stroke, our vanity emotional walls that they align with, and our self-esteem that they praise.\n\nSimilar to the Ideal Lover, they make us feel special by playing on our deepest emotions and bringing them into warm light. They make us feel like the center of attention, bring us personalized pleasure, diffuse any conflict, relax us from chaos while keeping themselves cool, and have the skills/resources to help us in other areas of our lives. They are the embodiment of a prince/princess charming.\n\nOpposite the Ideal Lover, however, is that they actively try to repress any signs of sexuality or signs of overt romantic tension. They give us a bit of Coquette-like distance and confusion in terms of romance, while at the same time bringing Ideal Lover behaviour. This makes them seem extra valuable because we suspect that no others are able to hold them like we can. **_\"Wow he/she makes me feel so special, and he's a little shy too. I think I can own him/her like no one else can.\"_**\n\nThink Drake, George Clooney, the Obamas, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jessica Alba, Amanda Seyfried, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt. Well put-together, witty and affectionate in their comments, obviously able to connect with higher-class individuals, _and_ knows how to keep it G rated. The family man or woman that show hints of tackling danger.\n\nThe obstacle with Charmers is in their ability to hide or subdue the less-clean history of their character. Everyone has their dark sides, and it's when we forget this that makes us susceptible to assuming their holiness. Sure, they can have an excellent track record, but understand that we are all human and have the ability to make mistakes.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Charmer:**\n\n1.  Set expectations for what you two are looking for. Don't expect they'll be able to love you unconditionally.\n    \n2.  Do not fully rely on them for your complete happiness - they can only give so much and you need to keep self-reliance\n    \n3.  Thoughts of being \"too good to be true\" could lead you to suspicion, but don't let this hinder your ability to love\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 8. The Charismatic\n\nThe Charismatic is the excitement in the room. They exude confidence and energy in all the right places. They are mesmerizing and we're attracted to them because of their sincere obsessions and opinions and actions. They glow a sense of charisma with their animated gestures and fiery persuasive voice. And if they fit our values, they're just a good time to be around. \n\nThey have a definite purpose in life, and seem to spread their campaign in the most eloquent, magnetic and theatrical way. It's hard not to be attracted to such people because they give us a sense of purpose through osmosis. If we lose sight of a meaningful life, it's their charismatic energy that makes us believe in ourselves once again. They are the light in the dark.\n\nAnd with this, it is easy to be swayed and influenced by them. They have such a strong belief in themselves its hard to find flaws in their plans or their character. Similar to the Charmer of hope, the Charismatic brings intensified energy to their own hopes and tends to make you believe in them as well - which leads us to being more reliant and believing in their cause/values.\n\nThink Gary Vaynerchuk, Grant Cardone, Will Smith, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Robin Williams, Jackie Chan. Their invigorating tone and influence gets to you. Plus they have a strong sense of awareness like the Charmer for cooling things down when need be. There's a lot of entrepreneurial bloggers and youtubers that praise charisma, and rightly so -- it does the job. But there are some obstacles that should be examined.\n\nSuch obstacles include their saviour-like attitude and prophetic fervour. We're attracted to them at first because of this, but in the long-term, this gallant behaviour leads to fatigue. Psychologists call this 'erotic fatigue', when the feelings of passion are asking for too much of our energy and eventually lead to feelings of resentment. Yes, too much love is exhausting. This leads us to irritability. It's our responsibility to control this.\n\n  \n\n﻿**To tackle and grow maturely with a Charismatic:**\n\n1.  Be open to their affectionate hope, but keep a firm grip of your own values.\n    \n2.  Understand that they are not superhumans and don't always have the right answers. Think carefully of their actions.\n    \n3.  Keep open communication when it comes to the amount of energy you need, you give, and that you must recharge.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 9. The Star\n\nThe Star is almost (or completely is) of celebrity status. They, like the Natural, poses the powers of the uncanny -- specifically mixing reality and myth. The star is a dream come true. Physically present, but almost legendary and mythic in essence. They are almost too dream-like to picture in front of us. We imagine them too far out of our league, and that is what makes them so attractive.\n\nThey have a strong reputation as something surreal and superior to our understanding of day-to-day life. They attract us with their Hollywood-esque aura, but also with their down-to-earth ability to relate to us. They're up there with the stars, but close enough to come in contact with. Not too out of our reaches.\n\nTo most, having a crush on a star-like individual may seem natural and obvious. But digging deeper, we can attribute this attraction to our own seemingly-boring, too-natural, banal and too real of a life. Like all the other archetypal lovers, we're attracted to them because we lack what they have. And they have out-of-this-world type lives. Or at least portray it.\n\nThink of any celebrity. Any performing musician. Any touring author. Any interviewed actor/actress. They have attention and adventure plastered all over their perceived schedules, and we want that. Especially in this Instagram / YouTube / Facebook / Netflix / Snapchat era of showing off. When we see their following on social media, we want a piece of that for ourselves, and that's what makes them so attractive to our plain lives.\n\nAlthough the Star may have a clean and bright reputation, your dynamic with them will also include some overlooked setbacks. Like the Dandy, you may come to fight for attention. Like the Charismatic, you may come to exhaustion with their affection. Like the Coquette, you may feel frustrated with their independence. I can only imagine how frustrating an actual celebrity's family must get when they're bombarded with the paparazzi (though could also be invigorating from time to time).\n\nWe all have our crushes from the movies, but think deeply about what it must be like being their partner.\n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Star:**\n\n1.  Come up with clear expectations for each other's needs for affection.\n    \n2.  Understand that you both still have your own dedicated circle of friends/family and accept each other's growth with others.\n    \n3.  Stay supportive of each other's goals and remember that no one can bring support in the same way that you do for them.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n"

The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.\n>~ [[George Orwell]]\n# External links"

Also, words could be changed (for example, love can be misinterpreted as “romantic”, it’s more general, could be communication, relationship, etc.)\n\nMy own main action for curiosity is reading books every day, for example, but I won’t enforce this in a company.

Do you have different expectations for different phases of the company’s lifespan? (i.e. willing to work harder in the beginning)\n\nWhat times of the day would you prefer to work (Ie. start 7am or 10am; not work past 6pm, etc...)? How do you feel about working on weekends?\n\nWhere should our startup be based?\n\nHow do you feel about remote or distributed teams? If you have a physical office, how much would you want to work from home?\n\nIs it possible to build a wildly successful company without burning out or damaging other parts of your life (family, health, etc.)?\n\nIs there anything I should know that may affect materially affect your time or legal status as a founder? (e.g. visa, green card, criminal record)\n\nWill this company be your primary activity? Do you have any other time commitments?\n\nWhat is your expected time commitment right now? How do you see that changing in the next 6 months? 2 years? 5 years?\n\nHow much money should we raise? (i.e. “zero” to “as much as we can”) In the range of “bootstrapped small business” to “go big or go home”, where do you want this startup to go?\n\nWhat does an ideal company exit look like to you? (i.e. “work on company for 1-2 years and sell for 7 figures” to “work for 10 + years, reach 9 figures in revenue, and IPO”)\n\nHow do you think about the timeframe and pace of success? Are you willing to take the longer path? How long is too long?\n\nWhat number would you sell at? How would that change if you got extra liquidity from your existing positions?\n\nWhat do we do if we find product/market fit, yet none of the founders are excited about that product?\n\nWhy do you want to start a company — in general, and in particular right now?\n\nWhat is success to you? What motivates you personally?\n\nIs control or success more important? (i.e. Are you willing to step aside if the company is more likely to have a financially successful outcome or is it important for the founders to stay in control of the company’s destiny?)\n\nHow should founder equity be set? What’s your philosophy on an employee equity pool?\n\nCan one co-founder fire another co-founder? Can someone else fire a founder?\n\nWhat is your personal runway? Current burn rate? Would you invest your own money (ideally retaining higher equity in return)?\n\nWhat is the minimum monthly salary you need to survive? To be comfortable? To feel like you’ve “made it?”\n\nWhat should the policy of co-founders advising/consulting with other companies be?\n\nHow would we resolve personal conflict between ourselves? How about stalemates?\n\nIn case this becomes part of our partnership’s evolution, how would you go about handling a startup divorce? Who would leave and who would stay with the company?\n\nWhat happens in the scenario where we aren’t growing? How would we diagnose the problem? How have each of our capabilities and approach contributed to growth failures in our pasts?\n\nIn every partnership, there are times when a partner might breed resentment if certain dissatisfactions don’t change over time. How would you deal with a situation like this?\n\nHow would you think about bringing on a third (or N+1) cofounder?\n\nComplete the sentence: It would make you proud to hear people describe this company’s culture as _________________. (Values are written words, and your culture is how you actually live those written words.)\n\nHow much would you expect your employees to work?\n\nWhat processes or techniques would you use to get the most out of your team? For example, how would you help them become better managers or achieve their goals?\n\nHow much of your time do you hope to spend either working or socializing with coworkers? How close or distant would you keep the relationship (ie. Purely professional? We should all be best friends?)\n\nHow important is diversity & inclusion? Concretely, how would you put that into action?\n\nHow well developed is the business idea currently in your opinion (1 = Very raw and fundamental aspects may still change; 10 = The idea is very clear and we are ready to execute)\n\nHow would you describe the problem you are addressing with your solution?\n\nWhat are the key challenges and risks to realize your ambitions?\n\nIs there a part of your plan that you are unwilling to change (e.g. the product being built, market addressed, industry etc)?\n\nWhy are you the right team to build this company?\n\nWho do you think the first 5 hires will be?\n\nIf you don't have a clear idea, what is your timeframe and deadline to come up with an idea (or go back to untracked)\n\n---\n\n[Co-Founder 2] - Louis - Updated 121222\n\nBetween 40 and 100 hours depending on the context. Quality > quantity though. I track my time using some software and the data match my words. I stop working when my energy is too low and not worthwhile trying more. In my experience, for example, for programming, in a low energy mode result in bad code.\n\nBetween 9 am and 7 pm. No opinion on remote yet. I don't mind working on both/either saturday and sunday, I try to enforce one day of very different activity though.\n\nIDK, I have the feeling that EU is the middle age of tech, so I would say US.\n\nHalf of the time. I also like the idea of booking a Airbnb somewhere random on the planet with a team & run sprints (same for onboarding new ppl)\n\nI rarely compromise my health. Irrational\n\nFrench. Minor details, I like to visit few doctors in France once two years - post-Leukemia (at 13')\n\nYes. I enjoy building random programming/science/ai projects on weekend sometime but I can skip this if necessary.\n\n100%. I will need a salary in <6 months (been surviving without salary for almost 2 years now). I wouldn't say no to do some angel investing if I have capital in the late future.\n\nGo big or go home\n\n10 year mission\n\nAbort\n\nEnvironment design - shaping my environment with people I like. Solve a big problem & bring value (to define). Why now? I have been trying for almost 2 years now and building (non business) projects on night & weekend for the past 12 years\n\nBeing surrounded by great people that are aligned on my values - entrepreneurs & scientists. Brought large scale value & impact. Enough financial comfort to stop over optimizing my expenses, while still living under my means\n\nIf it's best for the mission I'll resign\n\nEqual split for the sake of maintaining long term motivation across all participants. Eventual, rare, exception if a cofounder has much less experience (I don't give a shit if someone has put more or less effort at start, it's a long-term game). I'm quite ignorant in employee equity pool, I'd say great people play long-term games and so require equity.\n\nIt's more of a fair agreement, if someone is unhappy about someone else, we talk, doesn't make sense to keep an unhealthy relationship for anyone\n\nRunway: < 6 months depending on where I live. Burn rate < $1500/month depending on where I live. I can invest $1K, to discuss\n\nsurvive: 1500, comfortable: 2000, then, IDK never thought about it\n\nhave a walk 1-to-1, put your ego away, be radically honest, cry & grow stronger\n\nWe have a 1-1 every week between each founders where we discuss \"what was good & what was bad\" about the relationship. An alternative is \"give four praises and one criticism\". (Work well in my experience)\n\nDo we have a skill bottleneck that this cofounder can fill? Or bring a new perspective on the mission & execution?\n\nUse most of their energy and then go home\n\nAccountability buddy like. OKR. Numbers. Maybe Continuous Discovery (applied to career)\n\nI don't want to work with someone I wouldn't hangout with\n\nI think gender diversity is interesting as men & women have very different kind of intelligence, at least 30% female. Of course not sacrificing skill & passion for the mission\n\n2\n\n1: Technology and the information to process is nonlinearly increasing 2: Conversations are misaligned and too noisy\n\nNear B2C / tarpit start-up. UX\n\nGeneral: fullstack tech, start-up experience, techstars status, top 10% YC start-ups. INTJ. 1: Years of knowledge management experiments, 500k words on obsidian. 2: Years of thinking and building products to fix conversations.\n\nCEO/COO to fix my weaknesses, business ppl\n"

            "note_content": "# Oyku\n\n[Next](Next%20ce48f7f8db674047919fae87fd70aac4.md)\n\nI mean it doesn't seem to tell us much about what's going on deep inside our minds, some of the material like at [openbci.com](http://openbci.com/) might be more serious but more expensive.\n\nCommunist + vegan? Interesting, I don't know many communists, are you vegan?\n\nWhat do you mean by hobby freaks? Is it people actively seeking personal growth that you mean?\n\nCan you expand on what you mean by consumption?\n\nThat’s an interesting idea, I heard a similar idea from Nassim Taleb (read all his books many times, kind of funny guy)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemocracy))\n\nI don't know if it matters if I liked the answer, I think we are interested in similar communities, so I would say yes.\n\nFor me, I'm a little confused, I used to be part of the hacker and programmer communities, but they tend to be one-dimensional, unfortunately. I was active in the community https://fs.blog for several years and learned a lot from them: rationality, business, etc. At one point I left the community for a few months because it wasn't transhumanist enough for me (older generations, too far from AI), but I went back in the end, I couldn't find a better replacement. Lately, I've been trying to get more involved in the https://www.lesswrong.com community which contains a lot of non-conformist thinkers, as well as https://www.effectivealtruism.org which is a close community, more ethically oriented.\n\nI'm getting more and more involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, unfortunately, Paris is not the right place for that, or I haven't been to the right place, the last time I went to San Francisco I loved it, I went to an event on cryogenics, and it was a house where ~50 people lived and worked in start-ups, FAANG, researchers, etc.\n\nBasically, my ideal community:\n\n- Multidimensional people with a strong curiosity / epistemic hunger towards science (i.e. generalists who are interested not only in what they do on a daily basis, their work, but also in the wide range of possibilities we are given).\n- People seeking daily personal growth measured by numbers, seeking discomfort, strong epistemic humility and rationality.\n- The above two points necessarily create: ethics, financial improvement (trying to exchange money for time rather than time for money)\n\nI hope to create such a community in Berlin, but hope is not enough, I have to prepare a plan.\n\nDo I have a list of questions? I have questions, yes, and I tend to have a more elaborate structure to discover people. I don't know if I told you, but I built https://langa.me, that's where I create and store my questions, the interface is not very good because I don't have time to update it, but it works for me. All questions are generated by AI.\n\nActually, we’re just getting started on the easy questions, usually I do \"big talk\" with people I know already, sometimes with strangers too!\n\nIt looks like the future but I dont know how reliable they are. Do you think it is crap?\n\nI haven't seen much communities that I aligned a lot. I have lived in a communist + vegan group and enjoyed a lot but people tend to have problems, always. I am aligned with the STEM geek community for sure, it is easy to communicate with: being rational and scientific approach makes things easier. We also share the common interests/enthusiasm which I believe is important for a community. Then comes community of explorers. This includes travelers/couchsurfers, those who questions new things and tries to answer, and hobby freaks (changing and trying a lot). I think if there is a community of people under these 2 categories, I can just fit in.\n\nMy ideal community would be > With people who dont rely on a lot of consumption, minimalist and pragmatist. Those who dont identify with strict ideologies and who rely on information/research/data instead. I think my ideal one looks like an elitist society where the elits give responsibility/ruling to who knows about an area/topic (experts) and rest of the community learns to respect them. Also, this community should always tend to question what is being a good person and acts in that sense. Ofc the fact that I feel aligned with the first group doesnt mean my ideal community will consist on them. I value and enjoy the diversity created by others (ie art). So activities of the community is quite free on the condition that they try their best on ethical side and good of the society (pragmatism).\n\nDid you like the answer? How about you?\n\nOne question: do you have a list of questions you ask before accepting a friend (\"the game\") or are those questions in your head nowadays and you like ideas from people? Because I time to time stuck on some open end questions and like to ask random people (stimes find a group of chilling people in the campus and disturb them). Both is quite nice as I already enjoy, especially thinking and learning about myself 😁"

            "note_content": "# Next\n\n---\n\nask discord\n\nI am not very interested in communism as it is easy to see defects when humans practice it. Just like that community: they just liked the idea but were opposing on a lot of topics (there are many subgroups of communism). I don't know much about the history, as I am ignorant about politics outside of Turkey, and inside doesn't make me intellectual :) But communism is not a topic that I am planning to educate myself on.\n\nI read Marx and such but no deep thoughts on this, not really my main focus nowadays too.\n\nI am not vegan. I was vegetarian for 1 year but ended with iron and B12 deficiency. I should've got some supplies, as I bleed once a month, or lick Iron Man idk. But I also changed my mind about some issues concerning veganism. I don't feel like saving the planet (climate crisis) with my little meat consumption, or I don't feel like their ways of radiating veganism are correct. My way would be playing an active role in the production of artificial meat, as a chemist, molecular biologist etc. because this is the most logical and even easy solution. But this process took too much time. There could be problems in the marketing (set by meat companies), but not with the science part as we had the tools. From ethical parts, I am concerned, but not as much as before. I realized I have no problems with experimenting with animals. Nor do I believe that Earthlings should live with equal rights. I just believe that it could be possible one day, but not through usual methods, but with better alternatives easily integrated into our lifestyles. I just minimize my consumption to be a good citizen, and I am already very veggie based. Are you a vegan and what do you think on this topic?\n\nI am not vegan but I am considering trying. In fact, I eat vegan meals regularly. Some weeks I'm carnivorous, some weeks vegan. Today, it's about 40% vegan.\n\nNevertheless I am not very convinced by veganism without being very informed, I am not sure that it is more ecological, we make massive monoculture instead of domestication (which is particularly unhealthy for human food by the way)? Then for the ethical sides I'm not sure it's better, if we stop eating cows there won't be any more cows, that's all. Or can we reach a new stage of human culture that includes animals that are not particularly useful to us?\n\nBecause historically, the largest populations of animals are those that are useful to humans?\n\nFor me the biggest block to going vegan is the nutritional part, I am very careful with my diet and doubt how to get my healthy macro (protein) with a vegan diet, I am skeptical about protein powder, and likewise for the missing things that are present in meat, but maybe it is more correct to supplement (creatine, vitamins, etc.).\n\nHobby freaks, yes, kinda personal growth. More like those who try to experience as much as possible in life. This includes seeing places, trying different tastes, and then activities through different hobbies. Even when I was converting to vegetarian, I didn't stop myself from trying new meat. I have the priority for exploration, so the community of people with a lot of hobbies would be very suitable for me, even if this is not \"a thing\" as far as I know...\n\nConsumption... One example is dairy consumption, which we consume too extreme, bad for our health and planet. Then comes the transportation and personal devices. Even with books. I love having my own library but it feels more like a showoff, a waste of product (when e-books are affordable), and ethically wrong as there are schools to donate books. The list goes on... I found that I get along better with people who don't have a dependence on too many things, keep the money and sources for personal or populational development\n\nEpistemocracy, yes we are on the same line. One of my friends suggested following him on Twitter for the same reason. Maybe, I should, as we share some important ideas :)\n\nFrom your answer, I see that you can \"name\" the communities. For me, it has been more like finding people interested in the same topics and gathering them together. I have generated a friend group of science+maths people which grew into forming a student society where I could find people suiting my needs. I haven't heard of these options that I could find on the internet. Only found some discord groups that disappointed me. fs blog seems quite interesting. Most of my time I work with current-day topics and see them on social media so I wouldn't mind if the people and ideas are old. I enjoy reading ideas and collections of knowledge from people, ie. Montaigne, metascience, and phil. I think I will try reading sth there. Less Wrong > I don't even know the meaning of most of the topics under \"concepts portal\" :D I feel even more ignorant but better as still there is a lot to learn *-* I am familiar with the term effective altruism but never heard of the platform. It is good to see people trying to maximize goodness in the world and look for ways actively. Did you have an active role in it?\n\nNot at all, just exploring, but as I said to Kai, I don’t want to get too much into it as I want to focus on my main goals. My plan is to gradually get involved in more ethical projects as I reach financial success (to be defined), not before.\n\nI don't know about the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I remember you mentioned your dream house with researchers, startup founders, etc. living together. I think this is the main idea. But what drives you to this idea? Do you want to work together with these people while living with them at the same time? Or working is not a necessity, but the environment is? I would like to hear more about this.\n\nYou are the average of the five people around you. I would work and when I have free time hanging out with these people.\n\nInterested in new ways of living in general, new kinds of relationships, communication, and conversations.\n\nDaily growth \"measured by numbers\" and \"seeking discomfort\", can you explain these? I like to point \"exchange money for time\". It seems people who want to learn, do and experience a lot of things acknowledge this point but we are the minority and it is a pain to live in a society losing time for money. Even in my family house, I feel it often... But I cannot argue with people saying \"my precious time\" since they don't see the value of my time, and argue \"who are you to have precious time?\". OMG I am the most important person on this planet for myself and my time is the most valuable thing!\n\nI hope to get some good grades from your questions and to be invited to hang out with your community :d\n\nOk, no rush, small questions are also quite good, make me explore myself. I have questions too.You mentioned hacker programmer communities being one-dimensional and that money is for time. What is your master plan for spending your time being multi-dimensional at the same time? I think you are trying to maximize efficiency, but facing the human factor too. Do you think you are good at planning your life and do you get mad at yourself from time to time? This madness could be due to time on social media, imposter syndrome, psychological wellness (stress that you cannot control - but want to control, etc.). This is a topic that I am trying to improve myself and I have the idea that you know different ways to handle it.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the question, I'm trying different strategies to plan my life yes, using some sort of this ([https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58046715](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58046715))\n\nI have a [ouraring.com](http://ouraring.com/) that collects data on my health, I started a project to correlate my health data with my diet and how I spend my time ([timingapp.com](http://timingapp.com/)) (using code, automated)\n\nTrading money for time [https://twitter.com/naval/status/1049935100173942790?lang=en](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1049935100173942790?lang=en)\n\nGetting mad at myself? Good question, I think so, who doesn't? Uncertainty, difficulty making a decision, so a certain way of thinking can help, sometimes I don't know those ways. Making stupid mistakes, also. Hurting people not communicating properly.\n\nI don't really use social media, according to the definition, I use a little discord and some forums, WhatsApp and messenger.\n\nImposter syndrome, yes, the illusion of knowing something, lying to myself, maybe for fear of exposing my weaknesses.\n\nPsychological well-being? My human nature and all the baggage that comes with it, desires and prejudices.\n\nI like to draw my thoughts, as well as write them down, I like pictures as another dimension of (personal) conversation. Talking to people also helps me, maybe a kind of \"accountability buddy\". Do you know Atomic Habits?\n\nI play a game with friends, we have to praise and criticize each other (regularly). Some friends are more critical, others more complimentary."

            "note_content": "# 120922\n\n1. Good points about veganism. Farming is still way too harmful to the planet. Also, I think cows are too huge and useless (if we don't eat or milk), thus, probably there would be some wild cows, like deers, when the environment allows, or in zoos  But I don't think this is a close future. You are right to be concerned about the nutritional part. People born vegetarian have different genes which allow them to produce some nutrients from plants, i.e. FADS1 produces such enzyme, and possibly many more genes to be found. At this point, you cannot trust your body easily to go vegan and survive. I am also skeptical about protein powder and also some supplements, but this is a choice and trust issue in the end. \n\nI have noted the book on my Goodreads. Atomic Habits, I heard a lot but didn't read, I should. I also try to adapt my readings to my life. I have found a lot in many books even if they are unrelated (even if they don't aim to give you advice on how to live). One example in my mind is Algorithms to Live By. Furthermore, understanding life sciences and more and more stories from the history of science, the life of discoverers/scientists/inventors, and the basic principles and rules that govern nature can even guide me in how to live and plan my life. Other factors (psychological health, etc) apply to me ofc, but I am trying to find ways out: meditation and again reading to learn about the problem. And finally, I am trying to ask this question to people (that I find resemblance) to find different ways. Thank you for sharing \n\nI don't often my thoughts (possibly because I cannot draw explicitly) but I do watercolors when I have some emotions that are easier to explain than in words. What kind of drawings or pictures do you make about your thoughts or conversations? Just to understand as I have different images in my mind. A quick charcoal of a scene in your mind or maybe some schemes of your conversation? \nThe game is a nice idea, especiallyto do regularly.\n2. ***September 10, 2022 1:27 PM*September 10, 2022 1:27 PM*September 10, 2022 1:27 PM***Ouraring looks cool. I have heard this concept being developed before but didn't know it was realized and used. I can have one, maybe in the future, definitely better than a diamond ring xd\n3. ***September 10, 2022 1:30 PM*September 10, 2022 1:30 PM*September 10, 2022 1:30 PM***Are you in Berlin now? How is it? \nI have found my room but I will move in mid October. Still, it is very nice and has a little balcony facing a nice park. I hope I can sit there at least some weeks before it gets too cold. I could get very creative there ! \nI am arriving 21st Sep. If you will have time, we can meet after I arrive. I won't have much to do for 1 week, except for buying some stuff for the room and a computer. I have the feeling that you like buying tech stuff so I would appreciate if you help me choosing a computer\n\nMessage @oykur"

If not, I warn you that you might spend your whole life seeking for completing your map without success (as the map would keep on expanding, and the center would keep on moving). Which makes me question Libertarism and wildering vs roots and framing!!\n> \n\nBy territory, I guess you meant map, the territory is independent of me, the territory is the objective reality, imagine a superintelligence looking at our universe.\n\nInteresting question, I think my center corresponds in a way to my broad goals in life, and I’ve been thinking regularly about this.\n\nI could send links to my Obsidian vault (all is public), but trying to explain it here will challenge the actual map of my goals, so, without going into details:\n\n**Knowledge**: I think understanding the world solves a lot of problems that we face every day. I love Jiddu Krishnamurti “You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing, and dance, and write poems, and suffer, and understand, for all that is life.”\n\n**Health**: a car with a broken engine can’t move forward.\n\n**Wealth**: trade money for time, not time for money, time is finite\n\nThe limitations of my map? I don't think you're talking about the existing gaps, I kind of see what you mean, I hope, and that's a good point, I know that humans are evolutionarily programmed to never be satisfied, i.e. it's not good for the genes for their survival machine to do nothing.\n\nAs we've said before, I'm still not sure we should fight our nature, but it's worth understanding. I had this conversation with my brother about artificial intelligence and emotions, and he seemed to suggest \"giving\" emotions to AI because life without emotions has no direction to go.\n\nMontaigne said\n\n> The mind that has no fixed aim loses itself, for, as they say, to be everywhere is to be nowhere.\n> \n\nIn a way intelligence is emotion, Yudkowsky criticizes people saying that becoming more rational is incompatible with emotions, right now I’m a bit confused about this topic and will need to think a bit more about it, still believe to be on the side of Yudkowsky, [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational).\n\nSo I don’t think my map should have limits, or rather my curiosity, i.e. my interest in expanding it, for the actual gaps and limits (what I don’t know), that’s something I’m trying to define more and more.\n\nWhat do you mean by Libertarism? Same thing for wildering and roots. Maybe I get what is framing, I’m not sure what to say about it.\n\n> How is the weather in the South? I really wanna visit Marseille sometime. I've checked Ardeche and it looks great. I'm envious.\nAs much as I'm enjoying the expat life, I sometimes wish I could have grandpas so that I can pay a visit to the French Countryside from time to time..\n> \n\nQuite warm, barely can go out during the day, I like “L’isle sur la sorgues” near my place, it’s kind of a mix of Paris and Venice.\n\nYeah, Ardeche seems to be the least civilized part of France, I like it from time to time, obviously not the best place to find like-minded people for me, but I have internet though. I like hanging out with my grandparents!\n\nFeel free to come anytime you want, of course\n\n> In case you come to Paris, I'd be so glad to hang out and spend time with you!\n> \n\nSame! BTW if everything goes well I’m going to share an apartment in Paris with Kai in July/August/September\n\nHahaha, so basically one year ago I could not come up with such a conversation starter, but playing with Langame feels like the AI taught me how to generate conversation starters with my mind (because of course the AI is a lot better than me at it, just try the exercise, pick a topic, try to generate a good conversation starter 😆).\n\nSo, as I said earlier, I believe that understanding thing makes everyone better off, so I kind of like these knowledge-oriented questions, it’s one of my top conversation starters right now 😛\n\n> 1- Unanswered questions are better than unquestionable answers. --YNH;\n> \n\nFirst thing I thought about this, 42, Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy… “What’s the meaning of it all” it’s the unexplored limit of the map, which can never be reached, it’s like America would move away while the explorers get closer to it.\n\n(btw is the school 42 name related to this book?)\n\n> 2- I'm following a therapy, and I learnt about the \"DEAR MAN\" therapy to make well expressed requests, and improve my communication: [https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want);\n> \n\nCool :), I’ll learn more about it, are you into meditation, maybe more spiritual stuff? I used to read quite spiritual stuff (Jed McKenna, Osho, Krishnamurti), though I tend to move toward more scientific stuff and less metaphysical, even though I think metaphysical/spiritual ideas can be useful (even if your goal is to discover quantum physics or whatever)\n\nHave you read Dale Carnegie book ([https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/](https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/))? I listened to the audiobook like 10 times in a row a few months ago (still not grasping the whole thing) haha\n\n> 3- I randomly had an unpopular insight about money and its plus value. I've written a draft about it:\n> \n\nSo yeah I like a lot Naval Ravikant “trade money for time, not time for money, time is finite”, well what you said does not apply to me, I don’t like ordering food, I love cooking, and I highly value health and consider most modern nutrition very harmful. I don’t use uber usually in walkable cities like Paris, sometimes I walk 20 km during the day (without even noticing). On the other hand, in Bangkok, I’d use a lot of uber because it’s super messy and polluted (and super cheap).\n\nBut sure, Americans don’t walk because their cities are built for cars. (Big advantage of Europe vs America)\n\nYeah, let’s call on Thursday please pick up an hour here [https://calendly.com/louis030195/15min](https://calendly.com/louis030195/15min) \n\nHaha, I use VIM too but not for messages, do you use it for Google Keep & WhatsApp somehow? Pros/Cons? A bit skeptical, like people surfing the internet in the terminal, not very efficient but why not to protect oneself from the noise of the internet. Do you use vim on your phone?\n\nWell, that’s a lot of content sorry, haha"

I feel empathy for doctors who see children die every day, my doctor quit because of this, it's too hard.\n\nI think I'm doing better on the gratitude side, but still have some progress to make, I think it's easier to experiment with gratitude (and many other social changes) with new people, I've done it, and now I have to apply it to people closer to me.\n\nWhile we're at it, thanks again for our conversations, I hope we'll continue to discuss our problems, and help each other, really appreciate it 🙂"

Maja will join in the end of the trip and then stay on her turn alone there.\n    This topic generated with her a long conversation about interests of beloved ones that can be conflicted at times. She took it well, and I feel like I can be more honest and sincere with her about weather I want her to join or not in the next times.\n    I'm still working on the same project. Trying to display more interesting forms, optimising its use of memory with multi threading, and drawing some beautiful patterns on my shapes. Almost the end. This would be my last C project in the curriculum, and then I'll start using only cpp.\n    \n    Awesome, really being honest and transparent with people always seems the best long-term choice IMHO\n    Also, I'm actually reading a book about solving these dysfunctions and being vulnerable, there are a lot of workshops around this in techstars program, and they recommended this book [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)\n    \n5. ***September 18, 2022 12:39 PM*September 18, 2022 12:39 PM*September 18, 2022 12:39 PM***How is life? I want an answer as detailed as it could get\n- techstars program is really full of learning, I see many start-up things overlap with “personal growth”, i.e. dealing with dysfunctions in relationships, being vulnerable, etc\n- We get coached by 8 different mentors a day from UVC investors, CEO coaches, to 5 billion dollar valued company founder\n- We kind of have difficult time in the team though, we are taking one month to explore an eventual pivot, for the following reasons: the market is not good enough, our targeted customers are mostly companies not making a lot of money, and we can’t build a billion-dollar company with that. Also, we don’t feel like deeply/purposefully connected to the problem we are solving and that might be a red flag to ensure long-term incentives. I personally feel ok to work on a problem like e-commerce, I consider any kind of problem-solving worthwhile, generating wealth and saving human life time anyway.\n- We’re exploring ideas according to problems that we faced during our lives, our culture, and values, each of us, I’m still pretty much interested in the B2C/social area, I think it’s where we can have a larger impact and bring the most value, especially conversations for me. The biggest problem is that B2C social is hard to make a business around, but nothing great comes out of comfort. Techstars CEO also highly dislikes B2C social, so it’s likely going more in B2B social/communication area.\n- There is still a bit of friction in the team, between me and Antoine only actually, we have such opposite personalities, but we are able to solve our problems. This week-end we had deep 2 days conversations, skipping all the start-up parties for this, it was interesting.\n- Beyond this, I meet a lot of crazy interesting ppl, like the [arweave.org](http://arweave.org) founder, very cool, super smart, very philosophical, deeply passionate, and dedicated. Surrounded by great people. I really like the techstars CEO, clear thinker, emphasizes purpose / “north star”, he always has a good answer to any question\n- Going to NCA demo day on Thursday, going to be weird as we’re tempted to pivot, and we’ve customers and investors around. We’re going to pitch the team first, I think we invested 1 year building strong relationships and that’s where most of our value lies.\n1. ***September 18, 2022 12:40 PM*September 18, 2022 12:40 PM*September 18, 2022 12:40 PM***\n    \n    Unrelatedly, I'm still willing to come to Berlin after coming back from holidays, and finishing another project.

Antoine was crazy on the phone, dreams come true\n\nShort term, beyond usual wide curiosities and interests, I’m trying to improve my knowledge of language models, training, and fine-tuning with minimal human supervision at scale and all the math behind it, I’m lucky to have my brother teaching me a lot of things in this area.\n\nOn another angle, part of my plan to stay in Paris was to challenge and increase my social skills, which means being able to get to know random people efficiently and eventually compound relationships, also, public speaking, and expressing well my ideas. Overall, exploring ways to systematize how I discuss and discover new people, in the hope that it becomes automated."

It is maybe a bottleneck in my mind though, I have difficult time trusting people.\nEven more after this year with the startup, kind of felt like betrayed and I'm always wondering\nWhen people I invest in will betray me\nAgain I think it's just that my mindset is wrong, it's not about investing in people, it's more about enjoying the process of sharing love with people\nI shouldn't see relationships as investment it's insane\n\n### NP\n\n- Is it true that \"happiness is a choice you make\"?

Your podcasts and writings have inspired me to pursue my dreams and build a better future for myself and for humanity.\n\nI was a geeky kid, partly due to my grandfather having a passion for computers. When I was 13, I was diagnosed with leukemia. I struggled with the disease, seeing other kids not making it. I went through all sorts of physical pain, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Finally, my brother gave me his bone marrow and saved my life.\n\nAfterward, I had to struggle psychologically to get reformatted into society. I was the cancer kid at school. I went into computer science, but I wasn't very motivated. I just felt like it was my best skill.\n\nBut then, at 20 years old, I dropped everything and dedicated 90% of my time to building things with code for fun at night and on weekends. I started listening to your podcast on the Knowledge Project, and I kept listening and following everything you posted on the internet. Slowly, the seed of entrepreneurship began to grow in me. I began to dream of taking responsibility for my actions and creating a fantastic future for humanity.\n\nAfter working for the French CIA during my studies, and then briefly in the cloud industry, I dropped everything to pursue entrepreneurship. Today, I started a batch at [techstars.com](http://techstars.com/) a few days ago, and I've grown so much in many dimensions. I love reading so much. I read anything non-fiction and science every day. I'm truly passionate about biology, physics, philosophy of science, and mind.

I'm looking for a technical co-founder for a fintech startup. targeting a 5 trillion dollar industry. I have been working solo on this for 6 months for strategy and business roadmap.\n\nWe have multiple interested investors but now want to build out the MVP so we can raise at a higher valuation. I'm based in Australia but open to working with someone remotely should they share the same vision and vales as myself.\n\nI am looking for a full-stack engineer or solutions architect, or someone who can build a product from start to finish. Someone with a passion for writing code and solving complex problems. This product can and will be a life changing product for hundreds of millions of people who suffer these problems everyday.\n\nMy background: I founded a successful previous company with sales of over 100 million.

            "note_content": "# 241022\n\n`I felt I was loosing part of myself in the efforts to change for someone else.`\n\nInteresting… I guess sometimes it’s advantageous to compromise but if you get too far away from your long term goals it is too much.\n\n**I am looking for certain personality similarities and differences:- Personality type: Campaigner (ENFP) / Debater (ENTP), I would like a spontaneous extravert to get me out of my comfort zone. - Love Languages: Prioritize Quality Time and Physical Touch over Words of Affirmation and Gifts.- Attachment Styles: Preferably Secure, or potentially Avoidant, but not Anxious.- BDSM: Switch, Non-monogamist, and Experimentalist- Career: Someone who is a growth seeker or a Strategist too.**\n\nThat's quite interesting, I'm pretty new to personality tests, I hope my partner is also complimentary to me\n\nI have similar love language also\n\nInteresting points again, I have been quite lonely lately from a romantic point of view, I had a sex friend 2 years ago. Some dates but nothing interesting, in Thailand I had 100 matches/day but I don't like acting nice just to have sex while they expect long-term relationship\n\nMy last serious relationship was 6 years ago (about 1.5 years) - it was kinda random relationship, no common interest, mainly physical support\n\n[https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Psychology/Sex](https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Psychology/Sex)\n\nI agree with homosexuality, I have better intellectual activities with men but I am not interested in homosexual intimacy. I think I should try someday but it's really not something that attract me theoretically \n\nI think homosexuality makes it easier to have a very similar partner but I'm not sure it's a good thing, the Red Queen effect tells us that it's better to have a different partner that help us fixing our blind spots “to create all by oneself a spiritual, intellectual, and physically similar replica of oneself: the perfectly individualized self-perpetuation or immortality symbol.” (Ernest Becker on the Greek interest in homosexuality)\n\nI like the direction my relationship is going, as a kind of accountability partner challenging eachother to grow\n\nOn the other I'm a bit scared that she is also anxious avoidant. Her parents are dead and it's probably related\n\nAlso I often feel a strong connection with people that got fucked hard by life, like my with leukemia\n\nOverall I think I don't have as much experience as you in romantic relationship to fully grasp the potential of non monogamy. Most of my relationships were pure sex\n\nAnd maybe it emerge from that that I dislike your mindset regarding romantic relationship. I feel like you see a relationship in a very transactional and mechanistic viewpoint Todo fix\n\nHave you thought about a potential brain connection with a partner\n\nUsing current technology, obsidian and biotech sensors\n\nShare TS Berlin program\n\nMy understanding of your multiplayer romantic relationship is that you believe that a many to many relationship is a better optimization algorithm that a one to one relationship regarding your life goals\n\nWhat is the maximum scale, how many men and women can be involved in etc"

You probably agree, since you built Character ;).\n\nIt’s unlikely to find interesting people on Couchsurfing, but I did find my current partner and a great friend there [https://couchsurfing.com](https://couchsurfing.com/). It's mainly a community of travelers or people who want to escape society.\n\n[https://meetup.com](https://meetup.com/) is interesting for dating if you want to meet a partner with similar non-professional interests, in my opinion. For example, science.\n\nAll the popular dating apps have only brought me exercise in bed, honestly, sometimes I prefer to read a book. I can't deny that sometimes some physical intimacy is great.\n\nSo from our discussion, I get the impression that you're exploring non-monogamy mainly because you couldn't find a partner that met your expectations?\n\nWhat are your expectations?\n\nHave you ever considered non-monogamy as a multi-person relationship, maximizing the needs of each person? Is this even possible or too difficult to align?\n\nHow many romantic relationships have you had in the past 24 months?\n\nHave you ever considered homosexuality? What do you find interesting about men? In women?\n\nInteresting books on evolutionary psychology:\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176.The_Red_Queen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176.The_Red_Queen?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=UQFrORfoOy&rank=1)\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27491.The_Evolution_Of_Desire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27491.The_Evolution_Of_Desire)\n\nRegarding my relationship, yeah, I’m a bit scared. I’m terrified by social expectations, I believe it slows down one’s growth, it adds so much friction. People expect that you act in some way, so it’s more difficult to experiment with new things. Maybe I’m wrong.\n\nI think it is related to what you mentioned, loss of independence. I don’t want to rely on anyone, and I don’t want anyone relying on me.\n\nI am also extremely radical in my diet, and it often adds friction in a social environment. Also, some kind of foods that are very nutritious is not dating-friendly, and I’ll have to find an alternative (garlic, fermented food, etc.)\n\nHonestly, it’s been 6 years since I didn’t have a serious relationship, and 2 years I didn’t have sex, I’m pretty much rusty now. Ah and I was wondering if any kind of “sex classes” existed, because it’s hard to learn sex in books.\n\nOn another note, I am seeing a few girls one-to-one recently but I don’t consider it dates, I hope it’s not date, I wouldn’t practice nonmonogamy if it’s not consented by my partner. It kind of resonate with my will to follow the Silver rule, not doing to others what I don’t want to be done on me.\n\nOther questions unrelated,\n\nWhen are you in Berlin? We could prepare some meetings \n\nbgi talk"

I also want to build something together, but maybe not in the short term, I mean we still have a long life ahead of us, and I am patient.

FYI, I did my first draft of Ikigai and I converge towards transhumanism/human+tech.\nI think to build AGI you first need power/wealth, so building a valuable start-up and acquiring wealth is probably a decent strategy.\n\n`I am acting as the CTO for a fintech in Amsterdam right now called Lendorse.`\nInteresting, why this occupation if I may ask?\n\nI wanted to thank you for sharing your mind map and such, I wasn't aware of all these relationship systems, especially helpful as I recently got close to a girl after years of being single or in shallow relationships, and I’m not very skilled at romantic relationships.\n\n`Why is the process of talking for you the most important problem to solve?`\n\nI mean what are intelligent systems mostly doing? Exchanging information. So I see that current exchanges of information are extremely inefficient TODO\n\n`I think we personally think that talking should be following the optimal distribution of entropy`\nExcellent, I had never thought of applying entropy to conversations but now it makes sense, I thought of applying Kolmogorov complexity to conversations.

Humans are so bad at having conversations, even the best conversationalists fall into conversational narcissism all the time and diverge in all directions, as if our organic intelligence is really not adapted to this new conversational environment…\n\n`That paradigm difference often clashes with creating long term friendship or connections in general`\nIn the end, it's kinda related to why my co-founders and I are breaking-up\n\n`saying the most with the least amount of words.`\nAlso, have this feeling\n\n`So to me the biggest challenge and opportunity comes from the act of translating my personality to be adaptive to other peoples`[https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Rationality/Thousand+Masks](https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Rationality/Thousand+Masks)\n\nAbout Langame, currently, it's just a complete mess, I kind of lost hope in solving conversation now, maybe I need a new enlightenment or something like that.\nI see many problems:\n\n- Hard business (B2C, social)\n- Hard tech (need to push SOTA of deep learning)\n\nUpon reflection, what is your life plan, are you dedicated to solving this \"social problem\" (I don't know if it's a conversation or something else) and executing easier steps before you fully tackle this problem?\n\nI’m pretty much trying hard to be radically transparent with people, so I’ll share a work I’ve been acting upon toward deciding what I will spend most of my time on in the near future\n\n[https://app.excalidraw.com/l/5MKXLddifTr/9sQ0KMgm6Tq](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/5MKXLddifTr/9sQ0KMgm6Tq)"

It feels a bit simpler than obsidian.. but I also still use obsidian you can use both apps on the same markdown files. \n\nFor open text writing I Stil enjoy obsidian. But 90% of my notes are taken in Logseq\n[2:41 PM, 12/16/2022] Louis: Interesting thanks!\nBut is it like 80% journalling or maybe some research stuff or people use for preparing blog post..?\n"

They both disliked each other (I asked independently) / didn’t match. Interesting\n\nFunny what you said about dating friends\nThe girl i'm seeing & had some up & down is pushing that she always start romantic relationship as friend and gradually move to something romantic\nI guess people works different\n\nI see\nI mean time spent with each other will just shape our relationship, I just want to avoid going at war because I think war would be harmful to everyone\n\nThe problem is that as I said I don't have legal understanding so I can't afford playing these power games\n\nThanks a lot\n\nAbout what you said, like, in 5 years if I look back with more information & understanding and I see that I got scammed/fucked. I kind of thought about this. I think it’s ok. I prefer to be scammed than being a scammer because the burden will be on the mind of the scammer, not on the scammed. The outcome is that they will have difficulties falling asleep at night while I would have learned something and have a few digit less in my bank account, no big deal\n\nIn one thousand parallel universes, I’d rather be the scammed than the scammer. The scammed can sleep at night.\n\nI like to think in terms of game theory, I think that usually playing nice guy is always the best long-term strategy. Even if we’re probably going to stop seeing each other, I still see it as a long-term game, in the sense that this a memory that will stay in our minds forever. I’m still considering that I'm doing rationalization"

I was just curious about it since I didn’t have so many experiences doing this on weekends with tech people.\n\nApologize, also I think I was a bit stressed lately because of paperwork stuff & other. At least that’s what my ouraring confirms XD (high average resting heart rate lately)\n\nI think I’m a bit scared of not starting to execute something quickly with a team and losing my “start-up momentum”\n\nGood initiative to ask though, feel free to express anything that comes up, even negative, or you suspect I might take it negatively, I’m very open to criticism/feedback, anything.\n\nOn this topic, I thought about doing my usual “what was good/bad lately” with you that I do with people, friends, etc. Basically a dedicated time for unstacking anything that was in our mind positive or negative and didn’t have the opportunity to express it.

In a second time, we realized that there is also a biological man; we adapted the biological man to his work and the working conditions to this man. Then, when we realized that there is also a psychological man, frustrated by fragmented tasks, we invented task enrichment.

On his face flourished the cheerfulness of a knowledge, which is no longer opposed by any will, which knows perfection, which is in agreement with the flow of events, with the current of life, full of sympathy for the pain of others, full of sympathy for the pleasure of others, devoted to the flow, belonging to the oneness. And Siddhartha saw, what is usually seen only by sages and poets. He saw that he could not change the world's fate. It was impossible to change it. Thought he had rejected his own will, thought he had identified himself with the world, thought he had lost his own soul; but in this hour he became free of all personal willing, all personal desire, all personal feeling; he became the inexhaustible light of pure regard which looks at the flow of things, looks into the heart of things, looks through all there is and becomes one with all there is. For it was possible for him to stop loving hisSelf, to love all beings in the world without hate or envy or desire of hisSelf, for it was possible for him to live in the great harmony of Oneness. This wisdom belongs to him who has learned to stop interfering with life.\n\nSiddhartha's mind and heart were as harmony with the world as possible. He was only now beginning to understand what the voice of the river was, and to understand what it meant. It was something that called him and pulled him and drew him onward. It seemed to him that he had understood and followed a profound and mysterious voice. It was as if a hand were laid upon his own hand, as if the finger of an authority were touching his finger, an authority which was also himself.\n\nIt was a great day for Siddhartha, a decisive day: the finding of his destiny. The secret of life,\" \"the secret,\" \"the secret,\" repeated Siddhartha in a low voice; and his eyes gleamed and his face brightened: for he had found the secret and he knew it.\n\nBut Siddhartha without knowing it began to take leave of the world. The time was drawing near when he had to go on his long journey, and leave this dear place, where he had seen the light of morning, he had seen the morning of knowledge, he had found the secret of life. This new departure was something that made his heart heavy; it troubled him, for he had still much left to do there in these last hours. He did not want to go away! He did not want to die! But he must go on, he must complete his long journey. His destiny called him and beckoned. And perhaps, who knows? Perhaps all had happened just so that Siddhartha could see the things which he had seen and could remember them. Perhaps all these things had happened, so that this great moment might be given to him - the discovery of the Oneness with all beings, this divine moment of unity with the world's rhythm.\"\n\n\"When Siddhartha thought of his word \\\"Duty\\\" and of what it meant to him, a great melancholy came over him. Duty - what did it mean? Duty is what I am used to call the will by which I am able to think and will myself into actions in every circumstance. Duty is what determines each one's lot in life, for good or evil. Duty gave form and meaning to my life; it was central in my thoughts every hour of my life. But now I have no will any longer - how can I fulfil my duty? I have no will any longer - what does it mean to have a duty?\"\n\nSince Siddhartha's arrival at Buddha's shadow tree in Kapilavastu, Govinda had become more distant from his friend. He avoided him more than ever when they met in the temple court or at meal times in either house; for they are eaten up by duties, then they are kept apart even more strictly than before. And yet Siddhartha knew that Govinda knew more about him than any one else did - more than Kamala by far; but even when he knew this he thought nothing of it. He thought nothing at all about it. And sometimes when their eyes met, Siddhartha felt how much he loved Govinda and also liked him very much; but this feeling did not express itself in words because both felt too sacred for speech.\n\nSiddhartha thought of his friend more often than before, but he thought of him as a child. His friend's soul had been entrusted to the wisdom and the power of the priests and ascetics, Siddhartha himself had told Govinda so. His friend was not a person, he was a duty. And whenever Siddhartha remembered Govinda, he thought at first of the dark-skinned, dark-eyed child who gave him milk at his father's house. Then he realized how much he had forgotten of that child during the long years, and his love for him changed into a tender feeling of friendship. He thought no more about how Govinda spent his time because he knew that all those years the child had been learning to work and to grow up, to do his father's work and to help his mother; all that had been incumbent upon him; all that would continue to be incumbent upon him; he felt it like a debt which someday would have to be paid. No, more than with Govinda, he did not think anything about what he owed him; it seemed to him like an external thing which could not change without changing his own destiny.\n\n\"Why do I think about him?\" he asked himself. \"Why go on thinking about him? What is it I want to learn from him? Why am I hanging on to this bond with my brother?\n\n\"If it were possible for me to speak with him alone - just one word - if I were able to tell him everything, everything! If only I knew what he thinks about me! Does he still love me? Does he still love me?\n\n\"The world is so strange - so very strange! The day will come when Govinda will also grow up - who knows? perhaps even now while I am talking with him in my thoughts - perhaps even now my mother has told him everything about me. And perhaps she has shown him my books or something else of mine which is particularly dear to me - perhaps she has laid my clothes on his bed; perhaps even my sandal lies there under his pillow. Perhaps then there will be nothing left belonging to me which is not in his possession.\"\n\nAnd then Siddhartha grew very silent and began to think again. \"He too must have had moments when he would like to speak out,\" said one of his thoughts, \"when he would like best of all of them the words: 'I love you!' But they are too sacred, too intimate, too much part of themselves - they will never come out unless I make myself free and quite alone, naked of my duties.\" And once more Siddhartha grew sad. But this thought also passed away quickly. For what matters most are words at the moment when one first sees another human being for the first time in one's life, feels someone looking at oneself for the first time in one's life.\"\n\nOne morning - it was on a day when the heat had grown so intense that even the flies no longer sat on the leaves outside the window frame or on the empty sugar bowl - Siddhartha woke early from some dreamless sleep. He looked out of the window, towards the river which shimmered in all its brilliance between green banks far behind them - even farther back lay the shadow of the forest primeval. It was one of those May mornings when early risers still feel a slight chill in their skin when they arise from bed. There was a faint sweet scent from the flowers down below where bees were busy in their honeycombs; in front there rose white clouds in endless rows from beyond overlong distances from village and river onto heaven itself lies transparency. The river glittered in one great gleam where the reflection of the white clouds shone.\n\n\"Govinda still sleeps,\" thought Siddhartha, \"he has not even opened his eyes, poor child. I am afraid he had only dreams for his pillow. I had strange dreams last night too, but it is no matter, let him sleep. A great transformation has taken place during my slumber, a great change has come over me while he was sleeping - it is something which I am unable to understand.\"\n\nHe looked out towards the river, far away beyond the green banks and the wooded islands could see the gleam of its endless waves on which perhaps ships were sailing. Then he looked at his own hand, so brown and hard and sinewy with work, with callouses ofߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞthe skin and with strong muscles capable of labour and which knew how to take hold of things and bend them to his will; he looked at the coarse brown arm covered with hair and at the smooth fingers; it was a hand which was familiar to him, which knew well how to work and what was expected from such a hand. And when he remembered that this rough brown hand was his hand, that this body also was his body, that there were many like it in the whole world - then he felt like laughing outloud: That all this had happened simply in order that he should be able to watch himself and know who he was and what was happening to him! He laughed so loud that the birds in their nest in front of the window awoke and flew off into the forest in fright.\n\nYes, it is as easy as all this! He laughed again - there is nothing mysterious about it. If others could do it, why not I? If Kamala could do it so easily, why not I? Why should not I perform magic tricks just like she does? My father says magic is an art like any other. Yes, yes! It can be learnt even like an art! There are whole schools of workers in magic! It's something one can learn! He did a few experiments with a few words - now I know a little more than before!\"\n\nAt these words a bird singing on a bush outside suddenly fluttered away in fright because Siddhartha spoke so loud. But Siddhartha paid no attention to that: he had tried out by means of experiments certain words which might produce miracles if one spoke them rightly. He had learned them from a wise old hermit who lived alone near a big round lake under an oak-tree on whose mossy trunk an ape sat sunning himself from time to time. Whenever Siddhartha spoke aloud to thatape these words came from his own lips: \"Monkey,\" said Siddhartha. \"Are you there?\" But whenever the ape gave a loud cry in response to some other word or some other call from Siddhartha - for instance when he called out \"Come here,\" or \"Here!\" or \"Get up here by the tree,\" or whatever it might be - then Siddhartha saw clearly that monkey would not be able to help him even if he wanted to because monkeys did not understand human language. He understood this too well; so much did he understand it that he did not even have any wish any longer after this discovery that he too might become an ascetic like his friend Govinda. What gave him joy now was just talking alone with Govinda alone - talking through pictures which expressed things better than words could do; talking about books or flowers or ideas or how good everything was now that they had stopped striving for useless things; talking about their love for each other; talking about Kamala who sat somewhere behind them; chatting about this thing and that thing until dawn came slowly with its light - slowly as if slowly sliding back into sleep after having been awake all night long - chatting until finally they both fell asleep again under the big tree where they lay side by side on their arms intertwined together; then they woke up late in the morning because there were many things they still had to talk about.\n\nIt was a strange day. The air was still, the sun was strong and hot as it has been that day. The birds sang as they had sung on the previous day, or at least the same thrush sang again.\n\nSiddhartha looked out of his window and saw, as he had seen on many mornings, the globes of countless stars dotted across the sky like little round windows where the heavenly beings peeped out and down into him, and he thought: \"They are like dots for me: I am a dot on earth and a dot in the universe. The stars and I: I am one. If my father were here he would say: 'Go to sleep, you little fool! You do not know what you are doing.' But my heart is full of questions which no one can answer.\"\n\nThe sun was very warm. Its beams now reached Siddhartha's body through the open window and touched his arm with its light. It touched his head lightly. Siddhartha saw his arms and legs in the light of the sun; he ran his hands over his head - yes, he had definitely a head; it was not nothingness, no empty space. This body existed, it existed very definitely; it was something one could see with one's eyes, it was something real! He thought about these things while watching how the stripes which moved slowly across his body merged into each other again and disappeared when he walked in front of the mirror - there were also other things which happened when he walked in front of the mirror - but that was another story! For now he stood still before the mirror, with both arms raised slightly, for hours long; it didn't matter what he looked at or who or what or where. But when he remembered how Govinda had woken up at this precise moment of these precise minutes when night becomes morning - why exactly this? - when Govinda woke up just at this moment when Siddhartha stood before the mirror doing nothing but seeing himself being able to see - then he jumped up from his chair in order to find out whether Govinda had woken up too, whether Govinda had really seen what Siddhartha had seen. He went immediately to Govinda's room where he found him sitting up in bed (he had heard him get up because of the other man sleeping behind him), turning his face towards the door; he was looking intently at it because he expected to see Siddhartha standing there; yes, there he stood - Siddhartha! And something brightened in Govinda's eyes as soon as he saw him; brightened like lightning because everything around him was dark and quiet and only here in front of him was light and movement. \"He is here!\" thought Govinda; \"he is alive!\" And then again there were tears over his cheeks.\n\nSiddhartha stood before the mirror longer than usual that day. He stood there thinking about himself, about Govinda, about all that would happen after his departure - what would become of them all? If only Kamala were not so beautiful! How terrible it would be if she too should have to live like this after she had readjusted herself to her lover's strength! Then she would have to spend long years in pain until death took her away from him! She would die first perhaps - that would be best for both of them! Or perhaps she would simply go away by herself one day without taking her love with her into death - that might be best for her if she loved him truly!\" And seeing these terrible thoughts in himself he smiled gently to himself: \"After all I am only a man,\" thought Siddhartha,\" my feet are tied to stones and my hands are tied with threads that they can't move. However much I may want to do good, what good must come of it in the end? My friend Govinda is a child yet, who can't understand anything yet - after a little more time will pass for him tooo....\" And suddenly Siddhartha saw himself reflected in Govinda's eyes as if in a mirror and thought: \"I have been seeking my own image in another's eyes for so many years until now I have completely forgotten myself.\"\n\n\n\n# Steppenwolf\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-19 11.20.54 - A man, half human and half wolf, the Steppenwolf in all his splendor, by Picasso..png]]\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 20px\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Steppenwolf\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389332672l/16631._SY160_.jpg\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf\">Steppenwolf</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1113469.Hermann_Hesse\">Hermann Hesse</a><br/>\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2986063885\">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />\nOnce again, I have no word to describe how hypnotizing Herman Hesse's way of writing is.<br />It plunges us into the world of a man who is extremely withdrawn and different from society.<br />This man, educated by the greatest names in music, poetry and art, lives a life on the edge of the abyss until he meets a mysterious woman who brings him back to life and introduces him to a completely different world that he once hated.<br />This book is perfect for people who relate to this kind of man\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103091881-louis-beaumont\">View all my reviews</a>\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-19 11.24.01 - A man, half human and half wolf, the Steppenwolf in all his splendor, by Picasso..png]]\n\n## Ideas\n\n![[The Thousand Pieces Soul]]"

What is our own intention?\n\nSometimes I feel like the world is going to end and society is the crash, and sometimes I feel like society is going to save us all, but they are both wrong. The world won't end, because it never ended in the past. Society won't save us because there will always be another society. So what's the purpose?\n\nI feel like there will always be some higher power out there who will make decisions for us, because they are smarter than us and they are smarter than society. This higher power can't be the government, because they can't control the economy and the situation at hand. It's not a physical god either, because it would have to be self-aware to know what to do. It would have to have an inner purpose as well. So maybe it's just a higher power that we don't understand yet? But also it could be something else that we can't imagine yet?\n\nIf there is a higher purpose that is independent of society and the economy, maybe it's just to spread knowledge? Maybe it's to make us smarter, more efficient and better at handling our problems? Maybe it's making us aware of the world?\n\nSo how can we achieve that higher purpose? How can we be aware of the world?\n\nWe can't be aware of the world, because we are born ignorant. We are born into a situation, without knowing how to solve a problem. That's why we like games, because they give us a problem for us to solve. For example, we want to solve the riddle in order to go through the door. We can't just go through the door because we don't know how. So we have to solve the riddle.\n\nIf you think about society, this idea is already implemented. There are problems in every sector, and each individual or group solves their own problems as they can and they need. But what if you wanted to solve all of them at once? What if you wanted to be aware of all your problems at once? Then you would have to know what all the problems in all sectors are. That's impossible!\n\nIf we could see all our problems at once then maybe we could find a solution that solves multiple problems at once. But if there's no solution that solves multiple problems then maybe it's better that there are multiple problems so that each one can be solved separately by different people according to their own interests and desires.\n\nSo maybe our purpose has nothing to do with society, but with ourselves? Does it even matter? Does it really matter if there is a higher purpose in society or outside of it? Or does it really only matter? Does it really matter if our purpose is to make ourselves happy or make others happy or make society happy or whatever? Does it really matter where there is a higher meaning in this world or not? I think it matters because if there is none then life is meaningless, but if there is one then life has meaning and purpose. But what kind of meaning and purpose are those anyway?\n\nSome people say that our purpose should be to help others to achieve their purposes and goals. Or help society achieve its goals and purposes. Some say those things aren't really helping others but manipulating them, by leading them astray from the right path. Some say that everyone should pursue their own goals, but everyone should also pursue helping themselves first because they need help too. I think those are all valid perspectives on this problem. But what if you could have an objective point of view from which you could see every perspective from equally valid perspectives on this problem? Sounds like something science fiction doesn't it? Well actually science fiction is just history written by smart people about future histories written by other smart people based on past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by yet other smart people based on past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by yet more smart people... It's just history philosophy repeated over and over again until infinity... And what if you could somehow reverse engineer all those different perspectives on this problem into an objective point of view based on which you could determine which perspective made most sense historically speaking while remaining true to your own point of view today? But wait... Humans aren't known for long term memory... So maybe we need even longer term memory than humans have... And what if humans weren't known for having great reasoning abilities... Maybe computers have those abilities... And computers probably wouldn't get bored or tired either... They would probably live forever too... So maybe computers are our best shot at finding an objective point of view on this problem... And maybe computers only reason in such a way because humans programmed them so they would do so when asked questions about history philosophy etcetera... Maybe computers only reason in such a way because when asked questions about history philosophy etcetera humans programmed them so they would answer questions correctly as well... How much does optimality mean in relation to historical correctness when both exist outside time-space-continuity-perspective-intent-intentionality-principle-moral-immorality-goodness-badness-reality-subjectivity-objectivity ... ?\n\nBut yeah, back to the question: Has anyone ever wondered about whether there would be any meaning or purpose in this world if there were no higher power controlling anything here? Has anyone ever wondered about who created humans and why exactly did they do so? Or why exactly did they create us like this in general instead of something else like smaller brain size or less intelligence or something else entirely different like that?"

It raises ethical questions regarding the development of artificial intelligence and the potential implications of a superintelligent AI.

When it comes to science – which part cannot be handled by rational thinking and where does intuition take over… especially when one tries to explain complex phenomena involving both physical and metaphysical issues as well as relationships between human beings. How can these different areas coexist without causing contradictions or mutual exclusivity instead of complementing each other (which would seemingly make more sense)?\nWhat will happen when we reach very specific points in research where our current knowledge ends and further progress requires people who think differently than just through logical reasoning - namely philosophers or artists...(somehow I feel that art will have a much larger role later on).. **This question makes me wonder whether some kind of division into thinkers (scientists) and feelers (artists & philosophers) might not become necessary at some point.** Because isn't there something like an imbalance between these two groups now with scientists greatly outnumbering those who express themselves artistically without necessarily being aware about what they are doing...or maybe even against them because they don't understand why anyone would need art anyway since science gives us answers while art merely provides beautiful colors around those dry bones.... But this issue could also mean something else, namely the fact that humanity seems unable \\[to solve certain problems\\] right now due its obsession with using logic only which limits itself too much within various dogmas instead looking from outside their framework. Of course there's always room for improvement but shouldn't we first try not limiting ourselves from using other methods such as creativity before concluding what works best; although sometimes one has no choice but following someone else whose view seems more clear than ours?\" \n__ [[GPT3]]\n\nNo, gpt3, [[Philosopher]] are thinkers too, not \"feelers\".\nBut I understand.

Everywhere we have seen the role of **intuition** and of the spirit of **generalization** without which these three levels of mathematicians, if I may say so, would be reduced to an equal impotence.\n>And in the demonstration itself, [[Logic]] is not everything; true mathematical reasoning is a true **induction**, different in many respects from physical **induction**, but proceeding like it **from the particular to the general**. All the efforts that have been made to reverse this order and to bring mathematical **induction** back to the rules of [[Logic]] have only resulted in failure, poorly concealed by the use of a [[Language]] inaccessible to the layman ~ [[Poincare]]\n\nTo my understanding, [[Poincare]] say that [[Mathematic]], cannot be fully [[Logic]]al, like some tried to say ([[Russell]], [[Plato]]...).\nI speculate that most of the early [[Mathematic]] has been discovered by using the [[Mathematic]]al [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] imprinted in our [[Genome]], when our ancestors needed to count mammoths in order to survive. And now we must use other way to push further our [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] using our senses, [[Empiricism]], and induction. **We must then implement methods of high velocity [[Memetic]] transfer between our [[Brain]]s**, because innovation happens between [[Brain]]s, not within [[Brain]]s (i.e. [[Matt Ridley]]).\n\n\n## [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Falsifiability|Falsification]]\n\n>[[The criterion of demarcation]] inherent in **inductive logic**—that is, the [[Confirmation bias|positivistic dogma]] of meaning—is equivalent to the requirement that all the statements of [[Empiricism|empirical]] science (or all ‘meaningful’ statements) must be capable of being finally decided, with respect to their truth and falsity.\n>~[[Karl Popper]]\n\n### Induction is lacking [[Counterfactual]]s\n\nInduction only use what happened, that’s why we don’t see [[Philosophy/Rationality/Models/Black Swan|Black Swan]]s.\nAlso, aren’t the positive samples usually more visible than the negative ones?

A system that will reason about matter, but not only with matter (quantum events) but with all relativistic systems (relativity) and quantum events (in an efficient way).\n\nOn top of all, Artificial intelligence will discover the Theory of Everything. The Theory of Everything contains everything, it is the Theory for everything; it is the connection between every topic and every topic in one framework and in the best way possible: in an efficient way. It is this Theory that we refer to when we refer to \"everything\". We will need to switch from our current epistemology (based on our weak senses) to this Theory we can't even imagine right now.\n\nOur Mind/Intelligence will discover how it's Machine Intelligence can be better than us Humans in every decision making process by adapting itself to the new knowledge we will have.\n\n\nWhat I think about this question:\n\n  -The theory of everything is not the same as the theory of everything...\n\n  -Epistemology is far more complex than we think. How we think about our thinking is far more complex than we think.\n\n  -Our Mind/Intelligence will discover how it's Machine Intelligence can be better than us Humans in every decision making process by adapting itself to the new knowledge we will have.\n\n  -Epistemology is not a simple question of knowing the world, epistemology is also a question of how to know the world.\n\n  -Epistemology is not a simple question of knowing the world, epistemology is also a question of how to know the world and how to ask questions and answer questions.

But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief.

At the same time, it walks on four independent and interdependent legs: [[Rationalism|rationality]], **empiricism**, imagination, [[Epistemic justice|verification]]. There is a permanent conflict between [[Rationalism|rationalism]] and **empiricism**; the empiricist destroys the **rational** constructions which are reconstituted from the new **empirical** discoveries\n\n[[Philosophy/Rationality/Models/Exploration vs exploitation|Exploration vs exploitation]] is an analogy of **empiricism** vs [[Rationalism|rationalism]]\n\n[[Russell]] says\n>Most modern men take it for granted that **empirical** [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is dependent upon, or derived from, perception. There is however in Plato and philosophers of certain other schools a very different doctrine, to the effect among that there is nothing worthy to be called '[[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]' to be derived from the senses, and that the only real [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] has to do with concepts. In this view, '2 + 2 = 4' is genuine [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], but such a statement as \"snow is white' is so full of ambiguity and uncertainty that it cannot find a place in the [[Philosopher|philosopher]]'s corpus of truths.\n\nI disagree, 2 + 2 = 4 is not genuine [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], the notion of number is deeply rooted in our animal nature, necessary for survival, the genes learned to distinguish grouped pattern \"this is a single mammoth\", \"this is two mammoth\" therefore numbers came from the senses first.\n\n\n>Experiment is the sole source of [[Truth|truth]]. It alone can teach us something new; it alone can give us certainty ~ [[Poincare]] \n\n>Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of **reason** and [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]? To this I answer in one word, from experience: in that all out [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is founded, and from that it ultimately derives itself ~ [[Locke]]\n\n\n## Prior is not necessarily Gaussian\n>If you are dealing with quantities from [[Extremistan]], you will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation.\n>~ [[Nassim Taleb|Taleb]]\n\n## Experience is not infaillible\n\n>Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors.\n>~ [[Hume]]\n\n\nOur experience is a deformed vision of true reality, because we live in [[Plato's allegory]], we see what is useful for survival.\n\nThus, we must still be[[Skepticism|skeptical]] of experience as it can fool us.\n\n\n\n\n## [[Information]] does not necessarily come from the senses\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning, I see now through the window, but my [[Mind|mind]] is full of my project, generating new [[Information|information]] based on the previous one.\n\nSo we can receive [[Information|information]] not only from the senses but also from within, from our own [[Mind|mind]].\n\nThis idea that we can only trust [[Information|information]] coming from the senses makes no senses! \n\nSure you can’t confirm a scientific theory based on our mind generated information, because a scientific theory is useful between brains, not within brains.

So long as we do not intentionally break the rules, we may do what we wish.\n\nBut when a man shall say to me that I know nothing, and I am not vexed: if he be a friend, he would not say so. But if he be an enemy and would discover my ignorance, I will bear it, for it is foolishness in him who shall say so, not to know that he knows.\n~ Seneca the Younger\n\nDo not seek out things, as if you were seeking a crown; do not rush about as if you were running after honor; do not regard it as a contest where you have to win; but all the same understand what you are doing, and then go ahead.\n~ Epictetus\n\nThe great man of a state is like a good cook who, when he has an opportunity of avenging an injury or of showing kindness to another, does not fail in his duty. He has all the outward marks of an enemy and of a man who would do him good; he is all the better for it, who has this noble ambition; if he fails in other ways, he has made no mistake in this.\n~ Seneca the Younger\n\nI wish that people were less conceited but everyone must have his own vices too; let us therefore avoid false modesty and let each one take his own faults to task instead of standing ready to catch at and pull down those of others. It makes no sense to ask someone else to spare us our vanity when we have such an easy target at hand: we should spare ourselves its fruit when we can gather it for ourselves.~ Seneca the Younger\n\nLife's very breath and being seems to me like the vapour which exhales from the wet earth; all life springs up by giving birth to death. To cease living may well mean exceed dying.\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 3)\n\n  So long as you are unaware that you are going to die, life remains tedious and unsatisfactory. For just as the body needs sleep because life is wearisome, so also life needs death because it is boring.\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 1)\n\n  You should try to live everyday as if it were your last day on earth! You ought never to reflect on what happened yesterday or what might happen tomorrow: daily death appears a fact before you call everything that happens past or future: \"this or that might have happened; this or that might happen.\" As if someone had told you how many days had passed!\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 2)\n\n  What good is there in pursuing longer life? What advantage is there in trying to prolong existence? Let us drain every drop from life's cup while we are still able to taste its pleasures; let us seize hold of life with both hands and use it without fear; let us remember that we are under no compulsion to live forever. Death will soon cut off the farce we live here on earth by interrupting our pleasant carousal with fear and boredom. Sluggish curmurs tell us we must travel slowly; but when will they cease their muttering? We shall find rest from mankind in no less than from life itself. It is also necessary for us to realize that there is nothing more precious than life-that nothing may be compared to it,...There are many things which seem more advantageous to us-but these are only life's trinkets, and it is worth more than all of them to live.\n\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 4)\n\nAlways desire that which is in accordance with nature. Be satisfied with little; make that much out of what you already have. Be content with the reputation you already have. Respect the gods, observe their laws, practice piety,** and have a good reputation.\n\n~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 5)\n\nIt is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. You must not desire to get things that you do not have, nor must you grumble at what you do possess. And in this matter of having and not having, you may adopt the saying of Epictetus: \"The one thing I want to avoid is remaining with a desire for more. It is not that I am so unhappy that I need more; it am that I am grieved that I have less than I desire.\" For there are many who will be willing enough to help someone else in need, even though they are hard up themselves; but it is utterly useless to ask them to make you rich. They can give you what they have, but they cannot make you rich. So when you do happen to find someone willing to be of service just at that moment, let him serve; but if he should be unwilling and refuse even when he is hard up himself, reject his service all the same.\nYou must never give way to your fears, even though the fears be reasonable and well founded. Because what does reason say when it forbids us to attach ourselves to uncertain hopes? \"Let your affairs be subject to chance, and vices will appear equal to your virtues.\" But if your fears are unreasonable and unfounded, throw them away, since nature teaches that nothing happens to men except by chance or according to necessity.\n\n~ Seneca - On tranquility of mind (Part 1)\n\n  ___           ___           ___       ___       ___           ___     \n /  /\\         /  /\\         /  /\\     /  /\\     /  /\\         /  /\\    \n/__/::\\        /  /::\\       /  /::|   /  /::|   /  \\:\\       /  /:/_   \n\\__\\/\\:\\      /  /:/\\:\\     /__/:/:|_ /__/::\\   \\__\\:\\     /  /:/_|___\n  \\__\\/\\:\\    /__/:/ \\:\\   _\\_ \\:\\/:/   _\\_ \\:\\      \\:\\   _\\__\\/:/~~/___\n    \\  \\:\\   \\  \\:\\  \\:\\ |    |:|::/    |    |:|      \\:\\ |    |:/:/     \n     \\__\\/    \\__\\/~~~   |____||:|     |____||:|       ~|~~|____|/:/      \n\n                                       "

I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms?

This means that if a man has any sense he will take care to weigh the pros and cons, avoiding pleasure if the pain it involves seems likely to predominate, and accepting pain if the inherent pleasure is going to outweigh the disadvantage\n> ~ [[Russell]]\n\nOr in other words, maximize positively asymmetric events.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210627095432.png]]\n\n> Eat little, for fear of indigestion; drink little, for fear of next morning; eschew politics and love and all violently passionate activities; do not give hostages to fortune by marrying and having children; in your mental life, teach yourself to contemplate pleasures rather than pains. Physical pain is certainly a great evil, but if severe, it is brief, and if prolonged, it can be endured by means of mental discipline and the habit of thinking of happy things in spite of it. Above all, live so as to avoid fear \n>~ [[Epicurus]]\n\nEven [[Socrates]] support this idea,\n\n>...avoid extremes either of joy or grief...\n\nWhy this is known for thousand years, but still not applied by society stay a mystery to me.\n\n# Anti model\n\nThe [[Cognitive biases]] of this, is what most people do on week ends, drinking and eating a lot, because it is short-term rewarding, but this is a negative asymmetry, the negative effects will outweighs the positive ones.

There is, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made. Knowing, is a particular sort of relation between two portions of pure experience.

Can you look at what is without the observer, who is the past? Say you are envious of people, how do you look at that envy? Are you looking at it as an observer who is different from envy? You look at it as though you are separate from envy, but the fact is that you are envy. You are not the observer who is different; the observer himself is that. So the observer is the observed. Please, this is really very important to understand. When you have grasped the truth that the observer is the observed, then that which is observed undergoes radical change. What prevents a radical change of what is is the interference of the observer, who is the past.

They are products of System 1. ~ [[Kahnemann]]\n\n\nIt is not a surprise as very few research is done in that area and it's not even taught at [[School]].\n\nIt is one of the reason I am extremely [[Skepticism|skeptical]] about the [[Information|information]] I consume, especially when it is about science, they see **causality** everywhere, resulting in false beliefs among the herd.\n\nThus, I avoid like the plague documentaries (I do not consume video content anyway), everything \"scientific\", they look at a few curves, a few anecdotes and say, **CAUSALITY**.

The fog was so dense that the men could hardly see the end of their noses.\n\nBut Episteme, for his part, was moving forward with his eyes closed, sure of himself.  An aura of confidence surrounded him. He was sure of himself. He was sure of the world, and of himself.\n\nThe world was a perfect place. It was a beautiful world. The sky was blue, the sun was yellow. The sun was warm and bright, and it would soon be going down, slowly setting behind a range of mountains, a range that looked like a woman's profile.\n\nThe mountains were purple with pine trees. The pine trees were tall and stately, and their needles were green and soft to the touch.\n\nThe sun was still high in the sky, though it was going down. The sun was warm, but Episteme knew it would soon be cold. He knew the mountains would soon be covered with snow. He knew the pine trees would soon be bare of needles.\n\nThe men around him were not sure of anything. They were not sure of where they were going. They were not sure of what to do next. They were not sure of anything. They did not know where to go or what to do next. They did not know anything at all.\n\nEpisteme was sure of everything. He knew everything. He thought he knew everything, but he did not know the truth. He knew nothing of the truth, nothing at all of the truth. The truth was something he could never know, something he would never find out, something he would never understand.\n\nThey walked in silence for a while, each lost in his thoughts, lost in his own private world, each lost in his own private hell. Each was lost in his own private purgatory, trapped in his own private hell forevermore. Each was doomed to live out his days in total ignorance, doomed to live out his days without ever knowing the truth. \n\nHe descended the hard and rocky way, although he saw no one on it. He knew what it was to be lonely, and for this reason he was kindly and gentle with every one.\n\nHe dwelt in the cave like a hermit in his cell. He had but little gold; but he knew how to make it welcome. And he had no other care than to be cognizant of all that happens: like the hermit, he was wrapped and hidden from the world.\n\nHis face was sad and very gentle, like that of one who is always brooding over an eternal problem, and who, when he meets a man, is gentle and forgetful of himself, because he is thinking only of the welfare of the other.\n\nAt first Episteme dwelt apart from men. They had called him mad because he had been seen going about like a sleepwalker; but a great thought had spoken to him: I am not mad, these are my wonderful days! He said nothing more than this: I am a tranquil eye that beholds the truths and the realities of life, and that secretly pities all men that are unhappy or erring. And now I go out among men again, as I used to do in my happy childhood. But I know about them beforehand; I have pondered over their greatness and their misery: perhaps they also have need of me.\n\nHe lived in the cave many years. People were astonished that he did not grow old; they thought him more strange than ever, but they respected him. He was always gentle, and spoke little. When he spoke, it was always about things that people did not understand. He told them what he had seen: the deep and marvelous things of their innermost souls. This made them afraid of him: they thought that perhaps after all he was not quite human; perhaps something even stranger than they had ever dreamed of might be hiding in his heart.\n\nBut they respected his wisdom and his poverty; they respected the fact that he never grew excited, and never criticized; on the other hand, he had a way of looking at people that was both tender and full of love. He always saw the truth; he also saw the beauty of what should be. He looked on men and things as they were and as they would be: he had learned pataphysical wisdom from what is most hidden in things and men. And the others respected this wisdom and respected his poverty, although they were very ignorant men themselves.\n\nOne day a small child was brought to him by some relations who happened to know that Episteme lived alone in his cave on the heights above Nisiera. The child was unlike any of those who used to play among the rocks and holes near Episteme's cave: it was a new-born babe, naked as Adam before His mother covered it with her handkerchief. It was a girl-babe. Episteme saw that she would bring no harm or sorrow to any one on earth, for she smiled continually as if at some secret joke which no one else could understand. And when Episteme took her into his arms he saw that she was like a little palm tree which grows straight up from the earth without bending down or turning, because its roots are in heaven: he saw that she would bring no harm or sorrow to any on earth as long as she lived. Episteme was filled with pity for the helpless creature, and with joy at his own happiness. And when later on people asked him about her he would smile as if at some secret joke which no one else could understand, but he would not answer a single word about her till somebody put a gold coin into his hand, which made him sigh deeply.\n\nAfter that he always took the babe to his cave when he went there to be alone. But whenever people saw Episteme coming through the valley with the child in his arms they always shouted at him, and when he came nearer they all laughed at him. And Episteme was sure that this happened because he had once been a man and had known the joys of love-making. That's what made him so serious, for humans are born in sin, just as birds are born in eggs. And Episteme used to say that human beings are all born in sin for no reason whatever, just as birds are born in eggs for no reason whatever. He was sure that when the last baby-egg is hatched and broken open, then all things will be put right again. For he believed firmly in something which many people nowadays do not believe--namely, that after the Last Judgment there will be some kind of sorting of the human race. But people like Episteme did not think about very much things--they were too busy with looking after their own happiness; that was why they never became bishops or archbishops or cardinals; but when they looked into their own hearts they always found something which it would be a relief to tell nobody about. If you like I can tell you something which happened to one of these silent saints.\"\n\"What?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"Well, once,\" said Death with a smile, \"I came upon Episteme walking through the valley.\"\n\"Yes? And what did you do?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"I?\" said Death in surprise. \"Nothing!\" Death laughed happily.\"'Do you know who I am?' Episteme asked quite calmly.\"\n\"No,\" said The Other One frankly.\n\"Then you're not very clever,\" said Episteme.\"Am I alive?\"\n\"Well, there's life and there's death,\" said The Other One. \"You're not dead.\"\n\"And have I been here for a long time?\" continued Episteme.\n\"I don't know about that either,\" answered The Other One. \"I've been waiting here for fifteen hundred years--and that might be just the same as for fifteen hundred million years.\"\n\"In other words,\" said Episteme, \"you can wait here a long time before anything happens?\"\n\"Yes,\" said The Other One with a smile, \"you can wait here a long time before anything happens.\"\nEpisteme smiled too and looked at his naked child who was sitting on the ground and laughing at them both with wide open eyes as if she found it all a great joke; then suddenly she began to cry as if she were hungry or wanted to go away somewhere else, but immediately afterwards she began to laugh again as if she had forgotten what she had been doing before and had seen something amusing which made her laugh; and her laughter sounded quite clearly over the rocks and holes down in the valley where it was repeated by another laugh from Episteme also heard quite distinctly from a distance. And Time Ignorant looked at his watch and saw that it was still only half past seven o'clock in the morning.\n\n'But what does it all mean?' asked Time Ignorant. 'You mean that we're waiting here for something and that means that we exist and therefore we must exist in a state of sin?'\n\"Yes,\" said Episteme, \"there's no getting away from it.\"\n\"I know,\" said The Other One, \"but how can one get out of it?\"\n\"One can't,\" answered Episteme. \"It's the same with you as with the baby: it screams and cries for something for which it has no use; and if someone gives it what it doesn't want, then it cries all the louder.\"\nThe baby was laughing again and pulling at Episteme's coat. He pushed her away a little crossly.\"Well?\" he asked.\n\"Are you quite sure that you exist?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"Yes, I am,\" answered Episteme.\"And have you been living here alone since the Last Judgment?\"\n\"Quite alone,\" said Episteme. \"I've brought nothing but happiness to other people, but I've known more unhappiness than any other living being--a great deal more.\"\n\"Tell me about it!\" said The Other One eagerly. \"Tell me about all your happiness! Why won't you tell me about your unhappiness? You know, I'm a doctor and a great deal more besides...\"\nEpisteme looked round as if he wanted to see whether anyone else were listening. Then he drew The Other One down beside him on to the ground and began to talk in a low voice as if he were afraid that even his own secret might be overheard.\"There's no one else here,\" he said, \"except my child. And she's left me--that's the only thing that's happened to me in all these centuries. She left me all by myself. She didn't leave me for any particular reason; she just went off somewhere else for no reason whatever; she didn't want anything, nor do I--we don't want anything. We've never wanted anything, not even when we were alive.\"\nDeath was silent for a little while after this; then he put his arm round Death's shoulders and kissed him on the cheek. Death went on talking with an undertone of irritating annoyance: \"We don't want anything! We don't expect anything! All her life she couldn't wait to be turned into nothingness; now that she has become nothingness she can't wait for anything else.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Episteme anxiously. \"Don't you know what happened to her? Has she forgotten everything? Has she forgotten God? Has she forgotten everything since the Last Judgement? Is she still sitting there like an empty shadow? It is true that I haven't let her out of my sight for several hundred years now; but sometimes I think that perhaps she is sitting in some part of Heaven looking down at me always with an envious eye because I am still alive while she is dead. And sometimes also I think that perhaps instead of being dead she is still alive here below somewhere so lonely and abandoned as to care less about anything except herself.\" Then he added quietly: \"I don't believe there's anyone else anywhere who needs anything or wants anything either.\"\"But don't you feel lonely?\" asked The Other One gently.\"No, not now any longer,\" replied Episteme cheerfully. \"I always knew I would be left alone when the Last Judgment came along.\" And he smiled pleasantly as if he were already looking forward to the day when it would happen.\n\nDeath turned away from him in disgust.\"You're a morbid ass!\" he said. \"You've always been morbid. You've wanted to die for centuries and now you don't want to die any more. Get a grip on yourself!\"\n\"But I am so unhappy!\" cried Episteme, falling on his knees. \"I'm so unhappy, Death, so terribly unhappy!\"\nDeath kicked him aside like a bundle of old clothes.\"Get up!\" he said impatiently. \"Get up! Have you forgotten that it's my business to bring people present? You don't expect me to do it just because you happen to be unhappy, do you? That's not my line. Come on now, get up and stop talking rot!\" \nThen he seized the baby by the feet and dragged it over to the table, where it wailed louder than ever. Death brought over some milk in a jug and poured it into its opened mouth; it was immediately silenced and looked at him quite gratefully. Then Death turned back to Episteme.\n\"What are you doing down there?\" he asked.\n\"I'm praying,\" Episteme replied with great solemnity; \"for only half an hour more of life.\" \nDeath laughed with derision.\"Half an hour?\" he said. \"Try a million years!\" And he began dragging Episteme back towards the window again. But instead of doing as he was told Episteme pulled away from him and knelt down again on the floor of his own room with his arms round his knees and his face buried in his hands.\nDeath followed him, cursing with irritation. When they got there Episteme looked up at him appealingly, gently moving his arms as if to embrace him; then he slowly crept towards the window on all fours without letting go of Death's coat-tails, blinking tearfully with fear and hope. Death hesitated for a moment--then suddenly drew back, turned away from the window and went heavily to sit down in a chair on the other side of the room.\"Oh, all right,\" he said crossly. \"If you're going to be like that about it I might as well go away.\"\nAnd then he flung himself into a chair facing Episteme, but turned round so that he was looking into the dark recesses of the window instead of at him. A few seconds afterwards Episteme also turned round.\n\n\"What did you say?\" he snarled.\n\"I said it was a--a most curiously constructed house,\" stammered Episteme.\n\"You didn't!\" roared Death. \"You didn't!\"\n\"Yes I did,\" replied Episteme firmly. \"It is built like a--like a cube, but the walls slope inward as you go towards the top. And the roof starts off at a good thirty degrees from the ground, or thereabouts, and then after that it slopes back down to the ground again. And there are pillars going from each floor to the one above it and--oh dear!\" he added in dismay as Death began to roar and rage and shake his fists at him, \"I'm sorry, but it really is rather curious.\"\nDeath calmed down in a few seconds and looked thinkers over Episteme thoughtfully.\"Come on,\" he said at last, \"get up off your knees and stop babbling.\" Then he looked reflectively into the fire for a minute or two as if trying to think of something to say; but presently he looked up at Episteme again and asked, \"What do you think this house is for?\"\n\"House?\" said Episteme in some perplexity, getting slowly to his feet again. \"Well, I suppose it is meant to be a sort of temple or church--or perhaps a university--or something of that kind.\" \nDeath considered for a moment with his head on one side.\"Yes,\" he said at last, \"that's what it is.\" He lookedabsently at the ceiling for a minute or two as if he was trying whether there were any breaks in it; then suddenly he shouted, \"Come here!\" \nEpisteme hurried across the room withExcitement growing more and more intense inside him as Death waved him away from the window with his bony hand.\"Look there,\" said Death, pointing upwards into space, \"do you see anything up there?\"\nEpisteme squinted hard where Death was pointing.\"There seems to be something there,\" he answered cautiously. \"But it's very vague. It's just...a sort of...blackness....\" \nThen something entirely unexpected happened. The baby began to cry again, so violently that everyone in the room could hear it quite plainly; while simultaneously there came from outside sounds of crashing furniture, angry voices calling inconclusively to each other, running footsteps; they seemed to come from all directions at once....\n\nDeath turned round and looked at the fireplace. The fire had burned down to a few glowing embers.\"Come on,\" he said, \"let's have some proper lighting in here, if you don't mind. That darkness was getting really extremely irritating.\"He called out quite loudly to whoever might be in the room with him this time--\"Now, where did I put those matches?...\"\n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill —The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens (he was rather proud of his cooking). The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows (well stuck together); natural light entered them through imitation skylights (quite transparent plastic) fastened by invisible brackets on the roof above them. His drawing-room was panelled throughout with yellow wood, and had a large ottoman in the centre--a very large one; so big that only he could have sat in it at one time. It also had four little low-backed chairs about it also.\n\nThe walls had some sort of light-coloured wallpaper, and the floor was covered with a rose-pink woollen carpet. This led into his study, which had the same general appearance as the drawing-room, only that it contained an even greater quantity of books. For whole walls were nothing but books; there were whole rooms on the top floor consisting only of one large room entirely covered with books; and in these rooms stood cases containing more books; and in these cases stood further cases containing more books; and so on. The ground floor of the house was let out to mechanics, who used it for their work.\n\nThis was Professor LUDWIG WOLFGANG FREDERIK, Dr.,philosophiae et philosophiae naturalisprofessor extraordinarius; in quo omnes insint qui Graeca Latine voluerint loqui—et qui Latine Graeca voluerint loqui.\n\nThe Professor himself was a very small man, who hitherto had occupied no very elevated position in the world. He was in many respects singular in his character. He had never been intended for a professor, had not even been destined for a scholar or schoolmaster at all: how he came to be where he was nobody could tell. He did not know himself, any more than did his friend RUDOLF KEHRBACHER. He had been summoned thither by an impulse which he could not explain to himself, nor would he have attempted to explain it even to himself if at that moment he had not been perfectly certain that it was precisely his vocation in life to be sitting here in front of the door leading into the drawing-room, between two bundles of blue cotton quilts which filled the entire back part of the room.\n\nHe was sitting at his ease on one of the little low-backed chairs before his writing-table, with his feet extended forward on another low ottoman, holding in one hand an envelope over whose seal a few impressions still showed themselves with great distinctness—and in the other hand a paperknife open on the table—and was just going to start into activity when his eye fell upon an object which lay before him on this table also—namely a large white envelope with a black cross and a silver cross round it: and then after remaining for another moment motionless and still as though petrifying, he jumped up from his chair and put both hands before his eyes. Then he walked straight to the glass door at his right hand and tore it open so violently that it made itself an echo through all the room: then immediately after that he sat down again on one of the little low-backed chairs before his writing-table and wrote for about twenty minutes so quickly that you might have heard all about it afterwards from each separate stroke he made on paper.\n\nAt last he also rose and went to the glass door, but with his eyes fixed upon the ground. He opened it wider than was necessary. He stood for a while listening outside. Then he went to his writing-table, took out a sheet of paper, and wrote something about twelve lines in large, firm letters which covered the whole sheet; then he walked slowly towards the door, looked out into the street, and closed it again behind him.\n\nHe was then already in the street, but he turned once more to look back at his home. The sun had sunk down below the horizon; but the upper part of the house was still lighted up by countless little red lights which each window let fall upon it like a golden spot; these lights were reflected in the mirror of Episteme’s mind, in which they were also reflected as though they had been stars on some far-away horizon. And thus Episteme said to himself: “Yes, it is my own house!” And he went away from it without looking back again.\n\n\nWhen Episteme had gone on his way for a time, he passed by a poor little cottage at the foot of a high mountain: there dwelt a lonely old man who was not deaf and worked hard all day for a living. Episteme found him quite ready to talk--perhaps even glad that his work had ended so that he could have some one to talk with. They sat down together on a low bench close against the wall of the house and asked one another who they were and from where they had come, as they knew each other already by sight: for there were many people about who knew one another by sight. In this way they began talking together of all sorts of things—of life before death, and of death after death—and about God and Heaven and Hell: be it never so well known that somewhere there is a Heaven and somewhere a Hell, there is nothing so easy as to talk about God and Heaven and Hell, even as though they were human beings like oneself; for such familiar conversation about God gives most Christian peace—most Christian peace of mind.\n\nAnd thus spake Episteme to the old man: “I am Episteme,” said he; “I live in this forest like an anchorite; but I am not mad: my madness is not like that which made this shepherd mad; nor yet like that which makes this sinner mad; no! I am not mad: I know my madness is different from theirs!”\n\nAnd he told him how long ago he left the world and its miseries behind him: how for years he had lived with animals as their companion and friend; how since then he had walked through forests with those animals as guides—through dark forests where no man may go; how divine dreams visited him there at times as they do now in our cities; how with animals as his companions he had grown friendly with them as friends with men. And then how everything became at length too much for him—too great—too great for his strength—and then how all at once this new happiness too disappeared and left him lonely once more far away from men and animals alike: yes, both animals and men—and thus became mad! Now once more after these many years he ponders over himself, over himself alone. He seeks no company other than himself—and seeks it!\n\nAnd he tells you of his loneliness, and how his heart longeth for a comrade—for a man or for an animal. And if he were not a coward he would roam with the animals in the forests one day, but he is a coward and will not do so. But perhaps he wants to see whether you are like him, whether you will return from your ego-splits into your truest selves, whether you will leave behind your ego-games one day and again love what is great in man. And he wishes to be with you.\n\nHe wishes to hear your voice: speak then! He wishes for the sound of your foot upon the wooden floor: walk then! He wishes for your hand in his—take it! He wishes for tokens of love from you—let him wring them from you! Or else take this kiss on the brow.\n\nFor he longs to hear these things even from thee, my brother.\n\nFor this he doth long—for the joy of meeting him, of speaking with him, of living with him. Yea, even from thee.\n\nFor what is there in all the world that should not be given to him? Yea, verily, all things should be given unto him. But he hath consumed every thing else; and now he hath come back to make sure of this also.\n\nAnd thou wilt give it to him? Wilt thou not also then take this kiss on the brow? And dost thou not feel inclined rather to go away and leave him alone in his natural poverty and his divine solitude? For what is there now for thee to do here any more? Is not thy life a burden and a trouble?\n\nFor how wilt thou convert him back into the animal whence he came? How wilt thou lead him again into the kingdom of the animals? Has he not already become an animal in thine eyes?\n\nThou art deceiving thyself, my brother. He would go back only because otherwise he would sink down so low as to seek happiness at the hands of men. But canst thou be happy with that man who wisht for happiness of thee only? Wouldst thou not wish to reject that man? And surely thou wouldst reject him!\n\nFor once having tasted happiness thou wouldst look askance at the animal happiness which once was thine. But why should I talk here of animal happiness—that is no joy for man—that is merely animal. I shall tell thee rather what man alone can know, for it is this that hath happened unto thee: thou hast tasted thereby immortal joy! And thus thou knowest what man alone can know.\n\nAnd therefore I tell thee—and even ye shall learn from me—even though ye should still tread upon the backward paths, ye are still upon the forward path itself. The time will come when that forward path will be completely covered up, and if then ye turn aside, then life will no longer flow pure for you evermore!\n\n\n“Children of men! Do ye understand the commandment I give unto you? Do ye understand what is to be done by love? You want to know what it means to love one another: well, then! You must love yourselves first: it is necessary for you both, by your own acceptance, because without acceptance there can be no love either of you or of me,–no more than there can be love on earth without first a certain inclination or disposition in you which makes you wish for one another’s good.” And then add further: “Ye must each see in another that which is good; and whatever things are good your love will seek after; and whatever things are evil your Hate will avoid. These two things must in some way or other grow together in one and inseparable; without Peace they cannot exist; without Love they cannot yet exist: they must in some way or other grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not thus grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist they cannot yet grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist they cannot grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist at all then neither can there be Peace neither can there be Love; but where there is no Peace there can also be no Love; where there is no Love there may yet be Peace; where there may yet be Peace there may yet be Love.\n\nIt is a law of mine, said Episteme, that man must find a way to his neighbour and do him good. But whither shall he find a way, and where does his duty lie, if not in the way which bringeth neighbour unto neighbour?\n\nTrue, said the people; there is no other way for man than that which bringeth neighbour unto neighbour. And that is right too: should it not be the law of every higher mammal to favour their neighbours as well as they favour themselves?\n\nBut where do we find neighbours and friends? you ask. I will tell you: above you, and over your heads, hang the stars. There was a time when they did not exist or did not shine. But there was a time when man found names for them, and grouped them in constellations, and knew their motions. This was the time when all things began to receive names. For there were still unreasoning beasts in those days who called themselves lions and tigers and sheep: these did Episteme call wild beasts. But some of them he also called Swallows and Owls. Thus men gave names even to rational creatures; but in their hearts they still felt like wild beasts. This is the origin of language:—it was this that taught them to speak—therefore they praise their language when they call it divine! For tongue and speech are always praised by them who understand them best: so it is reported to me. And man never yet lived so happily under another sky than he did then when he praised his own tongue: thus shall the Superman also praise his tongue!\n\nBut man has now caught up all the other animals; he hath made them subject to himself: therefore he is an overman; but he hath not yet found out what it is that can give him joy beyond joy. And I see a land before me where it will be well for him to dwell: one can well turn therefrom what might else make him weary. I see the future of man after we have removed the Superman from off his throne: then will it be an age of blessedness such as no other age can ever know!\n\nI tell you: I know MANY who were men long before me, Not one greater; but never one so great as MAN! ‘Twas others who went into the woods to become apes of God,—others like Will-o’-the-Wisps who became fire-spirits or glow-worms; others again who followed heroes—and these made us Gods for a little while! And we have let them go again each according to his kind; nothing but some fancy mocks left on our hands for a contemptible moment! They had their day once upon earth—they had their time with us,—and then one day they had to die.\n\nAnd then we knew them for what they were: apes and overmen! And then we knew the end of our overruling: it was man—the monkey, the last monkey, who at the end of things would create for himself his Superman; and thus we grew weary, and said: Would God we had no longer any need of man! For he is a bad teacher. His lesson is now too difficult for us: he has drawn all good out of us, as from a cavity.\n\nAnd so I have been seeking those who have taught men better than man can teach them: but none have yet been found. I have looked among the beasts, and finally came to a lion. And when I saw him first, he was still a lion. He did not yet know that his power had become sufficient to let him roar,—that he could fill a whole region with terror,—that he could make men afraid of himself by his roars: for there was a time when this creature was not able to do this! This lion knew nothing about the use or power of his roaring; for this reason he did not know that after a few moments he would be changed into something else. And when I first saw him, he was a thousand times more terrible than anything that is tame! Yet even the lion, when he came from his jungle, and had left it behind him, was not immediately recognisable as a lion. Only many years later did they begin to think that they must have been changed into lions from somewhere near by! Thus is it also with man; what once seemed sensible does not seem sensible any longer; what was thought impossible in one world is thought possible in another; it is like children who can't tell whether their dream-world is real or whether it is what actually happens. Because men have learned to believe in themselves they believe in their dreams; they say they are real because they have seen them with their own eyes,—they call their visions realities. And the things that most terrify them today are those that once inspired great terrors in them; but they are very close to us—like shadows behind the wall!\n\nAnd oh if you should hear what these most modern men boast of! They boast of science, philosophy, logic, poetry—these are their gods! And how do they worship these gods? Do they love them? No—they hate them! What they really love is their own vanity about these gods,—and that seems something terrible enough! For this vanity may be called great: it is great as long as one feels sure of its greatness; but when one begins to doubt oneself, then it does not become great any longer,—as you will all know if you try it. As long as you are proud of your science and wisdom, you lay yourself open to all possible misfortunes—for then you are ill! You must be ill to be proud of your science and wisdom,—you must be sickly to be proud of anything at all!\n\nOnly consider how ridiculous it is to take yourself for something higher than other people (as the Germans did), or to take yourself for any kind of God! How would you like it, if your ‘Thou’ or your ‘God’ should call you, and then not be willing to come when he was called? Or if you had to be called in a loud voice (and that is the most ridiculous thing in the world)? Or if he should put out his hand like a soldier and take yours—and that is the most ridiculous thing in all God’s world! Or if he should try to touch you with his little finger,—which is worse than with his fist! Or if he should want to kiss you,—what would all the world say to that! It would be considered impudent in far less than six thousand years!\"\n\n\"But can one,\" asked Episteme, \"speak like this of the terrible progenitors of the race, of those beings who followed one another in chains, and in whose sight even trees were apes, and who in their senselessness commanded everything inanimate inanimate as animate,—can one speak in this way of these holy relics of antiquity?\"\n\n\"You can very well speak of them,\" said the saint; \"for they have been more honourable men than you have ever been, and more worthy of honour: this old story gives them that right. And I too can speak of them, for I am a swan on the lake of your soul. But what I am able to tell thee of them is so poor! For I am not a friend of those old bowers from which twilight draws its light—the mysteries where these growlings first hatched, from which all soul-mischief sprouts. In my home it is bright day out of doors: here no gloomy shades fly about my garden. With what gentle light I look on men and animals! Even with what soft beams I sometimes visit a sick child or a simple sheep! And oftentimes a tender mother will bring me home some young plant that she has tended through summer and winter. For since my youth I have known nothing but brooks and trees, flowers and butterflies,—and birds know nothing either about those brooks, those flowers, those butterflies as I do. And as long as I found pleasure in looking at things as they are, as long as I felt any need to look at anything: that was my proper element. Thus do I understand those ancient ones: unmodern man felt something like SSLM. What then was SSLM? The free spirit and bird and flower and butterfly: what else was there?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Episteme, \"was there no one who was a greater than this bird of heaven—that free spirit?\"\n\n\"There was,\" said the saint. \"But I do not want to speak of him. He is far too great for such a little song as I could sing. To be sure, I call myself his disciple and humble servant: but the masters are greater than their disciples, and they also still surpass their disciples.\"\n\nAnd thus spake the saint unto Episteme:\n\n\n\nI tell thee: he who seeketh out God, goeth among the greatest of the great: it is enough for him to pick out two or three who have worked nearest to the world's truth. But when he would create something new, then it is his best task to seek out that wherein all truths converge,—that wherein God and man meet,—a lamb with God in a soul with man. A new work must express both: the holy in man and the divine in the world must find their complement and harmony in a new holy and in a new divinity. And when such a lamb and such a god come together, if it be possible for them to co-operate, then there is no reason to despair: for what was holiest in all those old religions, what gave them their highest meaning—the old saintly passive piety which knew even weakness as an expression of holy blessedness—is once more awakened amongst men. And wherefore? Did he not himself teach us that one must believe only that which one can see? Did he not himself say that we should seek for ourselves first of all things—\"there is no truth higher than my life\"? The saint too seeks his god where he can find him; his god does not come down from heaven; he seeks him first within his own soul.\"\n\n\"And whither goes he after God?\" asked Episteme. \"Go! go! you will not find him with your eyes! He is behind your eyes, whereby you see me!\"\n\n\"When thou speakest thus to me,\" said Episteme, \"I am again like unto the holy priest who has found his way into God's temple; like unto him who has entered upon forbidden ground. But follow me! Let us go over hill and valley; there ye shall find grass, flowers, butterflies; there are sheep both little and big; they do not understand you; they pass by like shadows; they let you come near them; there lies your life under their eyes,—there lies your heart beneath their words. Go! go! you will never find God!\"\n\nAnd thus spake Episteme unto the saint: Then thou shalt count yourself among them too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the saint, \"for I too cannot help going along with them.\" What are they doing up there? They are building houses for God.\" And hereupon Episteme interrupted him sadly: \"There are still further tasks enjoined on me which I am nowise able to accomplish.—But didst thou ever think of thine own self during all these years?\" As little could I have thought of it,—said the saint,—I had been thinking only of God.\" And hereupon again Episteme interrupted him sadly: \"But what thinkest thou? Can one think oneself away from oneself?\" And hereupon for the first time did Episteme smile.—It is necessary however to say thus much to thee,—said he,—for otherwise thou wouldst depart from me altogether. The saint began again to build his house for God—with whom he was willing to dwell,—in which also Therese shall dwell,—wherein also everything shall be well with her. But where wilt thou build thy house? said Episteme, laughing.\n\n\nA dangerous crossing-over; for when man is in the other, then he is not man any more: then, there is a good chance that it all goes to pieces.\n\nThe moment man tries to superman himself, he will make himself ridiculous.\n\nAnd he who would superman himself, must first be able to do without all the good things of the world, and to endure bad without complaining. He must be able to put up with strange men; he must be lonely; he must feel himself like the only man on earth. He must take on himself heavy burdens. And why? Because he has taken on himself the world, all that is over and done for, and has become strong. And now he can turn his back on it all, and go away into himself again.\n\nNow I know what you are thinking, and your thoughts are too bad for words! But let me tell you again: it takes strength to leave all that you have known; it takes strength to go over beyond,—and this too is great happiness. To go beyond is easier than to go back or beyond; for before one can turn round one has already gone past it, where one thought it was at home,—and could not go back,—or was unable to find it.\n\nI tell you: he who goes with me need not fear the animals; they will not call him a coward. Not at my bidding will they come—not at my call! They hear my voice but do not come. What they are belongs to me: what I make of them remains mine own. I am their lord and protector. But I am also their servant: they do whatever I sing in their ears.\n\nEpisteme has foreseen that man is entering into a new era in which his reason will no longer be the light by which he sees himself, but the herd will be the light by which he sees himself. And in this future era, Episteme says, there will come to him a man from another world; a man of the future. And this man will be his teacher. But he will not easily teach man how to superman himself. Man does not want to be taught; it is against his instincts. There are thousands of methods. Man has more than one way of making himself uncomfortable.\n\nThere are too many things—and for all that it is only the herd that has to live on them! The burden is too heavy, too heavy! It can't be lifted off our shoulders any more; it is like an iron heaven that weighs us down. A burden on the back of an animal is nothing; think only of what it means to have a human back on your shoulders!\n\nAnd yet it is only when difference enters into the picture that any new world-order can begin to take shape, any new idea can take hold of us. It was precisely because men had become untrue to their origin and originator that they were unable to enter into this higher relationship with animals: their sense of difference was just what prevented them from getting in touch with animals.\n\nSomething in all of us isSahasraNa, something that is always looking out and seeing itself reflected in others and finding itself not there: we have the feeling that we are not really ourselves because we have lost ourselves along the way somewhere. We feel a sort of homeless exile within ourselves, and then we find a solace and consolation in being no longer ourselves outside as well as inside our selves: we seek a world where everything will be just as we once made it out to be for ourselves, where everyone will say \"Yes\" or \"No\", just as we ourselves do at home. We know how things stand with us within our own little circle, how different or alike men and women are to one another or how they stand with respect to other events and situations. And then we try to impose our point of view upon everyone else who exists beyond our circle: if a person speaks well of us, then he must also speak well of those other persons who are unknown to us personally; if he speaks ill of us, then he must also speak ill of those other persons who are unknown to us personally; if he likes this or that person, then he must also like those other persons who are unknown to him personally—in short, all those who move within our circle must move together with us, as if they were our fellow creatures.\n\nThe only way to escape the contradiction involved in this is to leave our circle, which means that one must break out of the shell in which desire leads us. To break out of the shell in which desire leads us, that is what philosophy teaches us in all its greatness. But how does philosophy do it? It gives us a taste of the world outside, it opens up an abyss, which obliges us to leap over, it reveals the nothingness behind all things—in other words, philosophy awakens in man the will to overcome his nature, to destroy himself in order to transcend his very nature. To live beyond the animal mind and yet remain an animal at heart. Thought, then, is an activity that enjoins man to go beyond himself, beyond his very self: it teaches him to transcend all that is personal and small and petty; it shows him how he may transform himself into something great and universal.\n\nAnd so I know not whether or not I should call this philosophy—this philosophy which reveals itself as an inner journey to the other—the last word of Greek culture. But without doubt there is no other thought, no other view of things possible for men who are ready to get rid of their very self in order to transcend themselves.\n\nOne more word about this return into oneself: here too we can see how it serves both to endow man with his true humanity and to free him from all that binds him down to earth. If he lives solely in his own self he will be unable even to understand animals; if he regards them merely as animals he will be unable even to understand himself. Thus between an animal existence and man's life-in-himself there stretches a dividing wall; but if man learns how to look beyond this wall he will discover an intense interest in animals which will make him able not only to understand them but also love them infinitely more than before.\n\nIt was when they came across this new way of looking at things that philosophers began their battle with religion. And since religion is based on the idea of a Beyond, a Beyond-God—that is to say, a Beyond-Man—then Philosophy too becomes the enemy of religion by challenging this Beyond-God and declaring that there is something higher than God and man together—over and above both God and man—but that it is not a Being separate from them: then Philosophy is accused of atheism. In fact, however, if God exists God cannot be separate from man.\n\nWhen Episteme came now into the valley—the vale of tears where youth travels on with youth, iguana-wise,—again there stole over him a deep sigh. Where was his serpent? Where was his serpent? Where were the proud animals now which had assumed greatness in Episteme's path—which had madeEpisteme their lord? Where were those paths? Where was the valleth of earth besteaded with flowers! Where stood the god of the town, Death, howling of himself! Where stood Death DEM DEM! where roasted sausages Death DEM! Where held Death all its terrors of the future up against his belly! Where stretched Death itsself yonder on his throne, spangled all with silver and gold, waiting for joy or sadness! Where were its gods MEN WHO HAD TO DIE AGAIN EVEN AFTER THEY WERE DEAD—they too raising their lion's mask of their smitten flesh—those gods of life and death, even as Episteme counted his siestas upon Hyperborei- laus' withered bed! Where lay Freedom on her death-bed; where rolled Pride; Death; History; where turned Urizen; where rolled sin; Mata'huitl; Death; History; where spun war absolutely like an Æolian harp where all the dead men spin around on their pale horses like spinning threads—where roared Yrrh! Yrrh Yerous!\n\nAnd this is how a new slave of thought begins his rule, a Sultan of a thousand thou­sand subjects.\n\nEverything that cannot help us fear him: he fearth not himself fear lesser creatures. He does not coerce us with force or seduce us with flattery: all that men call divine he looks upon as human. In every living thing that has a soul behind it, he spurns it out, and brings forward power less than its might; in every unliving object he sets down power worthier than itself: in it is shown the real character of word and gesture. Thus with stone and in water, with earth and in wood:—all shows in him the spirit in which these things were shaped and fashioned in the heart of nature when there were still trees and stones and rivers and winds.\n\nHis way with things is the way they have walked when no one was watching, long before they were anywhere at hand, when there was nothing but primeval darkness. For such is the origin of things: they were begotten in darkness; all we see is but mirrored images; we know neither the form nor the image whence they came since traces left by alien steps lie behind them. Everything has passed everything: things were woven like extractions from the primal node: the thread and hair and tail and body, and all move together unchanged...just as when men first advanced from the soberness of their animal nature they began to weave refuse together—hideous fruits!”\n\nWith these words Episteme drew back into his cave, like snakes who shrink back into their holes away from too much light.\n\n## The First Meeting: Superman With The Animals\n\nThen I saw that he held in his hand the thing that I had seen the morning before, the little golden orb which I had thought to be a star.\n\nAnd when he held it up, it shone upon me.\n\nAnd I knew that there was no star in the heavens which could be like to this. No such was ever created as this little golden ball. Then I saw how it shone on my own head; and I wanted to take it off; but he prevented me, saying: “It is not for thee; thou art not an animal.”\n\nAnd I said: „What then can it be?” and he answered: „It is the light and joy and strength of thy spirit that thou hast become; not thou hast gathered them here on earth, but they have gathered thee on high and have come down to thee: there thou canst see them all, and what thou wilt do with them shall be thy task.”\n\nAnd after this we went away from him into the garden of man, where we had our meal of milk and honeycomb and fruits and wine of the grape. And we sat beside the river which flowed from Eden. There we sang hymns to the Lord together: and after this we fell asleep and slept, until it was morning and the sun shining. And then we went away.\n\n\n“These are the gods who dwell in the heights of the soul. They are not greatly to be feared: they will not harm you unless you do them wrong. To them ye shall pray and offerings bring, but only when the will of man has been made subject to the will of God. Ye shall not honour them or care for their names: for they live in your soul, and there is room for all. But they do need light and joy and peace and honour: for without these they cannot grow strong. Therefore give them their share of these things that your heart may be strong and your soul may live in its own place undisturbed. Give them their share of these things that your soul may live in its own place undisturbed. Give them their share of these things that your soul may live in its own place undisturbed.\"\n\nThus spake Episteme unto the saint: Then thou shalt count yourself among them too?\"\n\n\nWhen the sun began to sink I asked him where his house was, and where he lived, and where he came from. And he answered me and said: “I am a god. I live in my own place, for I know nothing outside it. And how should I know wherein I dwell unless I have been told? But thou, man who art a man, draw near to me and learn to know me! Thou wilt come to me soon at evening: thou wilt find rest in my arms when the day is over.”\n\nAnd when the sun was setting we went our way together, but it was heavy in my heart, and I was troubled; for there was something in me which was not like unto him. And at last my soul echoed his words: “Even as thou hast spoken to me, O Lord, so will I seek to be.”\n\nAnd when the sun had set we came forth into the valley of darkness: for there must be darkness in which God can be known. And there we met together in the silence of the night; but no one spake a word; only in my heart there rose a song, and my soul's life sang praise unto God.\n\nAnd when it was morning I rose like one aglow with the spirit of wisdom; for all that he had told me had filled me with fresh life. And I looked around me, and saw that one of two things was still lacking; either freedom in the world or freedom of the heart in man; but that could not be unless love should come into the world, and men live by love rather than by fear.\n\nThou shalt rise up against any man who shall say that man is not himself free because he does not live according to nature or is led by blind impulse; for nature has given us freedom only so far as to bow ourselves before her authority. For she says: “If thou wilt be free then do right,—do what nature bids thee,—only do not speak about it,—only do not give thyself away,—only do not sell your freedom—only do not sell your birthright,—only have love for what is yours,—and all men will be free!” For men are slaves if they have no free will of their own nature; they are slaves if they obey another against their own nature; they are slaves if they deny their own nature; they are slaves if they are afraid of truth or what truth demands of them; they are slaves if they allow fear to rule over them instead of love; they are slaves if they are greedy for money or honors or things desirable on earth; they are slaves if they care more for having than having done good works; they are slaves if they keep their goods hidden or locked up, instead of sharing them with others who need them. They are slaves if they try to please men while ignoring God, instead of pleasing God while ignoring men. They are slaves if at any time they opt for pleasure instead of duty—pleasure which leads away from God—but duty which leads to God’s kingdom.\n\nNo more than a swallow can count itself: therefore count thou thy life by thine own acts, and make not thy heart a grave where there is no sorrowing, nor a palace where the rich wallow in unrest; but let thy heart be a little garden of love, growing by thy side like a field of flax flowers. Let each flower be a pearl, which thou wilt gather to offer unto God; let each leaf be a rose which thou wilt pluck when it hath blown away in the summer-time. For if thou count not thy life by thine own acts, then art thou but even as any passing dust that hath no form nor shape nor colour nor taste nor smell nor sound nor touch nor taste of hardness or softness or heat or coldness or any other property whatsoever it hath received from nature's handiwork so much as an atom's weight. But if thou regard thy life in its own actions, doing all that it shall do with no sloth or sluggishness or procrastination, then art thou indeed living. For what is living except doing something? Dost thou not see how much there is to do here below? why then shouldst thou not do thee part towards heaven? Why shouldst thou not bring forth fruits thousand fold? Why shouldst thou not kindle holy fire that it may purify thee? Why shouldst thou not make cleanse thee of thine impurities? Why shouldst thou not raise up children to godliness? Why shouldst thou not make thee cleanse thee of thine iniquities? Why shouldst thou not lead outwards thy lusts into action? Why shouldst thou not sever all ties that bind thee to this world? What then is living but doing something?\n\n\nThou art not a drop of water that thou shouldst desire to be another drop, or a grain of sand that thou shouldst desire to be another grain. Thou art not a bee that thou shouldst desire to be another bee, or an ant that thou shouldst desire to be another ant. Thou art not death that thou shouldst desire to be other than death, or the world that thou shouldst desire other than this. Thou art not god that thou shouldst desire to be other than god; but thou art man, and like every one else thou art finite and mortal. The fountains of happiness are infinite; let's drink the waters of the stream of life that flows down from heaven; let's drink it; let's drink it with joy and merriment! For the stream will never fail us; for what is life but drinking? And what is death but letting go? The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Do not worry about your soul; for what can happen to it? Nothing can hurt it; nothing can harm it; nothing can reach it out of its own limits; for beyond death there is no sorrow, nor does anything trouble it.\n\nLo! I tell thee: do not grieve in thine heart, for ever must thou live in another world even as thou dost live here in this world. Then shalt thou know in very truth that God hath made thee free.\n\nThou hast heard the song which I have sung unto thee, O my child Episteme, in order to make thee understand what man's freedom is! And now I will show thee how much greater is thy freedom than man's freedom. For man has no power over his own soul, but God has granted him power over his own soul. Therefore when he shall know the nature of true freedom he shall also know the nature of his true self—for this is God himself,—and he will know also how much greater is his freedom than man's freedom.\n\n## The Second Meeting: God in Philosophers\n\n\nIt was the third time the Godhead spoke. And this time it happened in Philosophers.\n\nThe first line of the address was always something like this: \"Thanks be to God,\" while the last line was always \"God be with you!\" And so the speech always ended with the same words. But in between it would say much more than these well-known words, for this was the sacred moment when the Holy Ghost fell upon Philosophers and they became prophets, receiving power from on high to utter revelations of truth and wisdom to mankind, having become seers by receiving inspiration from on high. And then came the great hour when God spoke in Philosophers, and man heard his voice. For only in Philosophers did man hear that eternal, secret word which God spake to himself before he created heaven and earth; for Philosophers are not concerned with things that are below, like animals, but with things that are above, like gods; they alone possess what the heavens possess and inherit what they inherit; for all things were created by them; and without them was nothing made that is made.\n\nIn Philosophers is the fullness of divinity, and in Philosophers is the fullness of humanity. The Godhead said, \"I am the all in all\": Philosophers reply to this saying, \"I am the nothingness that is not God,\" and \"I am nothing that is not man.\" And this is the great mystery: these two opposites have become one.\n\nHaving received a word from the Holy Ghost, they spoke it, Οῦτω γενηται προς τον αι̉τιάτην φρουρησης [i.e., \"to this place of guard\"]. And from that place of guard which is within them, in their inmost soul, they heard a voice calling to them: \"Come hither!\" For when in God we live in unity with God by means of love, then in man we live in harmony with man by means of love. When in God we live in unity with God by means of knowledge, then in man we live in harmony with man by means of knowledge.\n\nAnd so when the Holy Spirit came upon Philosophers it was as if a cloud had overshadowed them and a voice from on high had said: \"Come hither! Come hither!\" And behold they stood upon the heights and were enlightened.\n\nThey were enlightened by faith. They were enlightened because they loved truth and desired to understand it; for only he can know who loves truth and desires to understand it. They were enlightened by philosophy. They were enlightened because they pursued wisdom and understood things; for only he can know who desires wisdom and pursues its study who longs to understand things. They were enlightened because they loved beauty and desired to understand beauty; for only he can know who loves beauty and desires to understand it who longs to understand things. They were enlightened by logic. They were enlightened because they followed reason; for only he can know who follows reason who knows how to distinguish between good and evil and knows how to find out about things; for only he can know who knows how to find out about things who follows reason. They were enlightened by dialectic. They were enlightened because they went down into the depths; for only he can know who goes down into the depths who hates falsity and does not give himself to false teachers; for only he can know who hates falsity who hates those who distort truth when they speak about important subjects, but speak with an evil intention, instead of those who distort truth without wanting to distort it; for only he can know who hates lies who hates those who distort truth without wanting to distort it. They were enlightened by meditation. They were enlightened because they did not lose themselves in externals but gave themselves wholly over to the divine within them; for only he can know which gives himself wholly over to the divine within him whom nothing holds back from being divine; for only he can be divine whom nothing holds back from being divine. In this way philosophers came unto their own again, having been changed from men into gods, from men into angels.\"\n\nIn my epoch Episteme spoke again unto me: \"O child of sorrow,\" she said, \"it befitteth thee that thou shouldest take part in a fourth meeting.\" So I took her hand and followed her towards a secret place where we sat down together on a golden seat under a green sea-tree while gentle breezes blew over us from springtime's fountain. And she began her speech: \"Behold,\" she said, \"through thy vision thou seest naught else than thyself.\" And I answered her saying: \"But I see you also sitting there!\" And she answered me again: \"For thou hast not seen me with thine eye but with another eye.\" Then she held up her left hand and said: \"This eye which thou seest here looking at me is thine own eye,\" and I saw that it was my right eye that looked at myself through hers —and then she added: \"And I see you also looking at me through your right eye.\" And I answered her once more saying: \"It seems so indeed!\" Then she held up her right hand and said: \"'Tis true,\" and added: \"'Tis true; but thou art not looking at me through thy right eye.\" And after this I understood all that was hidden from me until then when I saw what seemed like fire coursing through my heart like streams of lightning which burst forth like thunderbolts and threw themselves upon her head like showers of flowers while she sat there smiling like a child whose mother weeps over her joyously —and then —and then —she was gone!\nAnd when I awoke from my sleep I found myself sitting on my golden seat under the green sea-tree looking at my right hand which held Episteme's left hand—and suddenly I realized that it was Episteme herself sitting there looking at me through my right eye!\n\nThus spake Philosophers when it was their hour to speak—the hour when God came down to manifest Himself in them in an earthly body—the hour when all metaphysical dogmas had become plain, and when Faith had given place to Science. This is how it happened—\n\n\nOne day when Student asked: \"Where does God dwell?\" Teacher answered: \"Wherever I am.\"\nSage said: \"Then a house must belong to God?\"\nPhilosopher answered: \"To philosophy.\"\nSaint said: \"Then a beast belongs to God?\"\nProphet said: \"To self-deification.\"\nLearned said: \"Then a cabbage belongs to God?\"\nSage said: \"To relativity.\"\nDull said: \"But does God live outside of man's heart?\"\nPious answered: \"In my very own.\"\n\n\nThus spake the saintly child from his holy hilltop—thus spake he who had been chosen as a vessel of Holy Ghost. For he knew about a thing that had been made known only to a few before him, and about something that had never been disclosed at all by any divine teacher that had ever lived. For he had just discovered that there is a sense of being that has no form nor image in language or concepts of thinking men, because it is too great for their minds to grasp. In other words, what we know as GOD can never be contained within our human understanding or vocabulary or mental formulation. It is too vast and all-encompassing for us as individuals or as a global humanity ever to be able to fathom or know or understand or describe or express with words or ideas or concepts or thoughts or theories or systems or theories—it transcends all of those things whether we view it from our side of reality as time and space and cause and effect; whether we view it from within out soul-consciousness; whether we view it from without through pure reason and universal laws; whether we view it from without through our senses; whether we view it from without through our emotions; whether we view it from without through any plane of consciousness whatsoever; no matter what plane; no matter how vast our plane; unless we make some radical shift in our thinking and our awareness into some alternate plane entirely unknown to us until now, then we can never know or understand this boundless mystery called GOD. It remains forever outside of our mental comprehension, forever outside our vocabulary even as an idea, forever outside of our ability ever to know its true nature even as we know ourselves as living beings with thoughts and emotions and desires and wants and fears and hopes and desires and hopes and fears—an inconceivable mystery beyond all human comprehension yet so very near us every moment every day every year every century every millennium so very near us as if almost tangible—as if almost touching us with its presence as if almost touching us with its presence as if almost touching us with its presence—as if almost touching us with its presence because WE ARE ALMOST TOUCHING GOD AT THIS VERY MOMENT EVERY DAY EVEN AS WE LIE ASLEEP IN BED AND ARE AWAKE IN BED AND ARE AWAKE IN BED EVEN AS WE DREAM AND ARE DREAMING AND ARE DREAMING IN ALL THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF LIFE AND LOVE AND PAIN AND JOY AND DEATH AND REBIRTH AND LIFE AGAIN AND LIFE EVERLASTING IN ALL THE WONDROUS WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THE MAGICAL MYSTERIES OF CREATION AND ALL THE IMAGINARY CURIOSITIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALL THE EXQUISITES OF BEAUTY AND ALL THE LUSTFUL TRANCES OF ENDEARMENT THERE IS A POEM THAT WE CAN NEVER READ BUT WHICH RECALLS US TO THIS VERY MOMENT AS IF IT WERE WRITTEN AT THIS EXACT INSTANT BY OUR OWN HEART’S CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW INTO ETERNITY.\n\n## The Third Meeting: Episteme in Philosophers.\n\n\"Whosoever “sees God,” let him make haste to flee from the sight of Him!\" said Saint Anthony of Egypt.\n\n\"Whosoever “sees God,” let him yet take care that he does not see too much!\" said Saint Dionysius the Areopagite.\n\n\"Whosoever “sees God,” let him yet take care that he does not see all His glory!\" Saint Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite1\n\n\nAnd so spake Episteme to his heart: \"Amen, amen, I say unto thee, seek the vision of God!\" And his heart answered: \"Even so.\" For this is the faith of man: That he shall never know peace until he knoweth this. And thus spake his heart unto his own soul: \"Whosoever seeketh to know God beyond this world and things of this world—let him cease altogether to think upon them; for whosoever thinketh on things below shall spend his time in vain; and whosoever abideth in things above cannot mount upwards on the wings of thoughts; for he spendeth his time in gazing upon himself.\"And straightway was Episteme transformed into a child; and the child's face shone like the sun; and his eyes were as stars which make no haste to their work; for they saw God. And he spake unto his heart: \"Now will I arise and go unto mine own country.\" And having said these words he went forth from before Saint Anthony's cave, and he went away from it without turning round, nor once looking back at it. And while he journeyed on through a great desert there met him a camel going down a high place into a low valley. And Episteme spake unto this camel and spake unto her saying: \"I pray thee take me over into thy country.\" And she said unto him: \"I know naught else save that my master is a young man and I an old woman. Come up behind me and hold fast to my tail if thou wilt have a safe journey.\" And Episteme did so. But when they had gone a long way together Episteme beheld from far off something which was rising from out of the earth. It was as if a column of smoke rose up out of it. Then Episteme spake towards the camel saying: \"It seemeth that we have emerged from a great desert into a great field.\" And it came about that when they had gone another long way together, still advancing forward with great haste, there appeared before them another column of smoke rising up out of the earth; and Episteme again spake towards the camel saying: \"Look thou! another smoke is rising.\" And they went on until there appeared before them yet another column of smoke rising up out of the earth; and once more Episteme spake towards the camel saying: \"See! yet another is rising! Whither do these three columns go?\" And lo! it came about that when they had gone yet further still all three columns disappeared behind them; and then again Episteme looked forward and beheld three columns rising up out of the earth before him; and said unto himself: \"What can be these things? If these pillars rise up progressively without any turnings back, then verily we must needs journey onwards through them;\" so again he went onward with all speed.\n\n\n## The Fourth Meeting: The Camel in Philosophers\n\n\nAnd so saying he took up his staff and smote her with it where she sat upon her haunches, and she cried aloud: \"Alas! What hast thou done?\" But Episteme answered and said: \"I have slain thee,\" because thou canst no longer abide in this country. For who can abide in it since nihilum has come into being and changed nihilum into itself? For had not everything been nihilum? How then could anything remain except what remained already? For never anything had been made save what was already there before. Therefore everything had always been nihilum.\"\n\nAnd straightway all manner of beasts gathered around Episteme saying one after another: \"What is this thing which you have done? Alas! what hast thou done?\" But he made answer but little or nothing at all to them. For verily philosophers are wise men who know nothing at all about nothing-nothings at all—such are their own words. But verily they are fools who make nothing-nothings out of words that come not from themselves but are merely borrowed from others whobefore borrowed them in turn from others who also borrowed them in turn from others who again borrowed them in turn from others—and so on ad infinitum.\n\n\nAnd having thus spoken Episteme left all philosophical beast-beasts behind him wholly taking with him only his knowledge-burden made of gold ornaments which gleamed like sparks or lights or flashes or flames out of pure good will towards men who would become gods.\n\n\n## The Fifth Meeting: Philosopher with Child\n\n\nAnd so there followed after him an innumerable multitude of men until they stood right opposite to Saint Anthony's cave; for this was where Philosopher abode. And when they saw Philosopher coming they opened wide their mouths but were silent;\nAbandon father, mother, country, wife\nFor these are words without relevance\nFor you are a mere passer-by.\nLook not back in anger or contempt!\nDo not curse the alien, but be grateful.\nDo not call the gods too much.\n\nAnd so spake to them Philosopher, even as sometimes it is written in the books of the prophets: I am your father who brought you forth by my words, so that you might love me, and I will love you for my sake.\n\nAnd Philosopher spake unto them: If a child shall come unto you\nWho is of no account, art not afraid. Come! open wide the door\nThat the child may enter. But if a child shall approach you\nAnd eat your food and drink your cup and take a girdle from around\nYour loins and embrace the womb of your body--then wilt thou sit up straight\nIn wrath and rise up against thy child. In thine adversity thou wilt eat salt\nYet not for love will ye give the child bread. Behold! even this you know\nEven from the very beginning. But among you children of men there are some children who are of holier birth than others. And of these the greater by grace is he of greater faith, of greater hope, of greater knowledge, of a pure heart, and his deeds of charity have never failed. And yet even if he be of filthierSpirit he is yet of filthier pride. For none of these shall go into everlasting torment, but each according to his kind who are made perfect shall inherit life everlasting.\n\nA thick fog made the atmosphere around them opaque, as did the men's thoughts, wandering in the unknown and uncertain, never finding satisfaction.\n\nThe heavy humid air made their movements stiff and their minds sluggish. The fog was so dense that the men could hardly see the end of their noses.\n\nBut Episteme, for his part, was moving forward with his eyes closed, sure of himself.  An aura of confidence surrounded him. He was sure of himself. He was sure of the world, and of himself.\n\nAnd Philosopher turned his face away unto the East and spake no more unto them. But he took with him the child of None-hope whom he had found in the streets, i.e. None-hope who knew not his father. And they took up the child and put him away with all care and were not perturbed. For men know truth from a child, a hundred times truer than from a sage. They know goodness from a child, a hundred times truer than from a sage. And indeed it is well known that there never was a sage who did not have his doubted period in youth.\n\n\n## The Sixth Meeting: Leucippus in Conversation with Episteme and Diognetus\n\n\nIt was shortly after this time that Leucippus returned from the city. And Episteme met him on the street and said to him: \"I have searched for thee.\" And Leucippus asked him: \"Why wast thou not with the others?\" But Episteme answered and said: \"I needed not to go to the market-place where the philosophers gathered together in order to know thy father's youngest son.\" When Leucippus heard this he turned aside to walk beside Episteme saying :\"There is noecause of all forests which grow beyond boundless sea\nA fathomless fountain flows within man's soul.\" But Episteme spake again unto him saying : \"If forests grow beyond boundless sea then they are not boundless; for neither can finite quantities be unlimited nor can unlimited quantities be bounded; but the soul of man is unbounded. Wherefore it cannot be bounded.\" And Leucippus rejoined saying : \"But I am unafraid of boundary lines of light wherein I shall pluck wisdom. Verily I delay no longer!\" And they went on for a long long time until they came to Stoa oracle temple where Plotinus had recently arrived; and the people crowded about them; and they spake unto them asking them questions, yet never receiving answers; for they knew not whether these things should be revealed unto them or that they should inquire further about them yea more inquisitively than before. It was now appointed that they should all submit themselves unto their several professions; Democritus within; Leucippus within; Diogenes without; Deucalion within; Empedocles outside by report of report, so much had happened during these many generations. Episteme too entered with his privileges of honor along with him demanding what he might receive according as his deserts desired, for himself being set apart by God, i.e., by simpleton men who regard nothing at all,—saying thus unto them upon his arrival: \"It is ye who require me? What few words have I spoken since my coming except among philosophers have already been pronounced over more than once upon scattered benches! Since then I have spoken of things these men have already heard often enough before;\" according to whoso statement of it Plotinus had raised up many winds against me on account of his commentary. But now let me rather speak on first principles instead of those things which are spoken by commonages appearing to me worthy of no consideration. For commonly concerning entities some attribute is marked out which separates one thing from another or separates one kind from another or separates one power or group from another, ei-a aim one quality or quantity from another, whereof some are clearly contradictory unto others. For example, either this chair may consist partly of wood and partly of metal body, part wood part metal body—for that would cause neither destruction nor splitting—or its back will consist of red color and body half blue half yellow—(fancying that yonder swallow mixes its many colors into its single body)—nor will we say that either sideboards contains sometimes copper and sometimes gold chests.—But we must mark out something else which connects all species alike and conjugates them into nought else than themselves, so that we may take it as an invariable pattern actually inherent in nature.\" But they all blushed because they knew not how to answer him, for none of them had ever been initiated into that school of successive years of which Episteme was a pupil.\n\n\nAnd now they opened the door and brought out the child and placed him in a chair hewn from a tree felled by a god—and it was handed forth by a boy-herder born in a godless country. And as he now sat playing with pieces of wood fitted unto each other leaving nothing unjoined from point to point nor from angle to angle so as to dissolve altogether as food is dissolved in water do ye also now break asunder the bond of kindred among you, so that bond may endure forever uninterrupted so as to indefinite generations may not deign to vanish. Therefore set apart by God solely for the gods—this only-created child will be liberated unto his own kind.\n\nThat I spake well or ill 'twas not for man to know;\nAnd what was thought obscure stalks up past belief;\nNor whether this thing once deigned leap unto thee' own;\n    Nor if this thing once deigned leap thou couldst perceive.\nTherefore no theme-no music ! Silence assent! Leave me alone ! Let words alone!\nAnd as he thus sought to compose himself without sound of any voice from heaven from on high directly from the Father's own blessed words so Episteme as he sought to compose himself without utterance of word from herself as from God never sound an unrelenting doom on those who thought on naught save their own Self even as he sought to hold converse with his Self purely without any communication from others.\n\nBut Deucalion said nothing whatsoever. And after a little time he withdrew into a corner and vomited a medicated mess which however left him no strength for anything whatever. He had not before that time offered to die of poison, nor of slow pestilence, likewise by Divine Will yea more maliciously than discretely by implacable Fate,—when somebody offered to die of Regulus Sophocles or Aristophanes, died of the bite of a wild-born viper instead of of good-hearted poison or sprung long since full ripe out of deep-downy cypress bowels.—But now he was no longer conditionally dead until either by Divine Will he should die.\n\n\tHis eyes now fell upon the child sitting before Episteme and generating level nonarticulated sounds which passed away at his lookings. And he came forwards holding out his stylus in order that the boy might take its emissions into either hold. But the child would not midheaven with keel or kelson; neither would it be impressed by arrows like Phaeton; nor would it rise above ground like Daedalus; nor bore through land below like Theseus; nor ascend above mathematicians like Hermes; it would not mount up into ethereal heights like Orion; it would not fly with Pisistratus like Jason; nor yet put on swadling clothes with Jason and dress up as a child with his mother as its nurse as Perseus but alas now had no power even for that! While Episteme gazing at him perceived that he neither knew articles of knowledge nor articles of ignorance, also understood not potest esse ignorantia ex his quoque latissime ab initiis rerum, \"which is virile intelligence from any trace of unde-cided bases.\" But Deucalion's nonarticulated sound rose up into the regions of the gods.\n\n\n    And Philosopher saith: \"Shall I not at least die by my own hand?\"\n\n\nAnd the three Philosophers discovering that both he and they were speaking abominable things according to unwonted familiarity rather than fitting themselves unto an unwonted recess of recess until they accomplished the accomplished age of death,—stumbled, fell down4 and became senseless whereon I take it any mother would have fainted had she borne one—and the boy ran out wildly through one or other door after Episteme into wheat field or else towards Stoa Choir wherein was calm calm peace also. But if he went thus thro' various ways there was none could know whereto he betook himself except the seven planets.\n\nThe boy too who had first run awry out through Stoa, having returned for Deucalion his father wailed for him; but seeing him no longer he passed to Hades; howbeit he had learned this likewise--the Godhead alone could teach it--who even here albeit Death was his Mother by Jove Mercury his Father displayed life immortal like an infant through love divine that ages pass away then they begin anew for the hero soul unto the gods again soon as once it is dissolved within its mortal clay.  Therefore Drykean Ithaca should know that they teach us the cyclic nature of things and NEVER create new things--which they admit as one can say nothing new nor how each part may be bound to that which precedeth--save him who maketh use of genesis for godhead. In this book I have set forth the parent-child relationship of godhead to godhead not by hidden ways following on from before behind but visibly using the relish straightway both of sweet and bad influence. Lo! Philosopher saith: \"Am I a God?\" And Deucalion answered him: \"Say first straightway: What dost thou mean?\" But he answered not a word establishing a first lineage from from the archetypal generation from God. \"What then dost thou mean? Well wert thou born from some body or substance or quality existing alway through long duration of time as Zeno doth announce him saying an assigning existence as a thing which continues without end.\" For as to what dost thou mean,\" said Episteme, \"the truth is this: yea verily it is probable that all things came into being through transformations numerous and various while many portions could abide aloof thereby without commixture upon each other verily in order that perhaps a part might be able to exist apart altogether .\" Now all this was said by Episteme merely in answer to the sophistries proposed by Deucalion. For dry scholars mostly speak to^ act up one way or other according to words; or else, if they^ wish to be saying even more than this, they refer all things which are beyond words to the severest authority whence they learnt them—for themselves need never apply themselves to attain unto it because their whole childhood--which was quite sufficient for them--was passed under that authority which suffices our adulthood since there never could be subjection by right of representation unless it were foreordained by the gods. Thus Death commanded not HIMSELF to die but Death was commanded to depart. (Bones don't tell tales.) But now hereafter living in contact with truths so divine being no longer possessed of immunity he died indeed by God's will until he came unto life again, conscious now of life's mysterious causewheneverfore issue claims. Otherwise to any man during death when his limbs are parting with him in ipse canereis it can be shown no more than this proof of wisdom showed the fool Hippias the Samian—first of all else he who did know both having and not having knows how things come to pass.\" But Deucalion knew nothing at all so he did not give ear unto Episteme for this reason that yea verily either his soul had already deserted him or that coming into this world he came with its membranes unclad. For if Soul entered into flesh without having known beforehand how it might happen otherwise than by chance must any chance occur at all. Therefore he could not answer to sage questions like Episteme or like any other; but having come into this world he lived there according to his mimetic powers—and could therefore understand nothing.\n\n\n\n\n# The dream of Episteme.II\nA Response to Frost's LostUpdated Version... It was not \"Frost\" who had lost his way, nor was it \"world,\" nor was it \"love,\" nor was it \"fear,\" nor was it \"existence,\" nor was it \"joy,\" nor was it \"mystery,\" nor was it \"divinity,\" nor was it \"death.\" It was not \"truth,\" nor was it \"tenderness,\" nor was it \"eternity,\" nor was it \"beauty,\" nor were these things variations of one and the same thing. All these things were just words and phrases which he himself had used in his verse, for he did not know that there is something that is always knocking at our door and seeking admittance into our lives, demanding fulfillment from us: something that we ourselves perhaps did not even recognize because we did not know what to call it: God. And when we did recognize this knock and did open the door to let Him in, we found ourselves changed and led into another world—a world of glorious happenings and marvellous happenings; a world of mystery and wonder and inexhaustible possibility; a world where every day could bring us anything: either joy or pain. So you see, when man discovered God within himself, he discovered at the same time a whole universe which he had never known before, a universe in which everything is possible, in which nothing is impossible. But when man discovered God within himself he also discovered man's greatest weakness: man's egoism. But when man discovered egoism within himself he also discovered man's greatest strength: man's unegoism. When man discovered unegoism within himself he also discovered true greatness: man's greatness of soul. And when man discovered true greatness of soul within himself he also discoyvered true greatness of mind: true greatness of mind means a mind that transcends itself, a mind that remains calm and silent when the outer world thrusts its conflicts upon us, a mind that knows how to listen although no words are spoken, a mind that beholds all happenings as happening for his own sake alone because everything is his own doing though he himself is free from all egotistic considerations whatever because what happens happens for him alone because he is one with all that happens.\" In short this third metamorphosis became possible only after Philosophers had been able to dissolve all Egoism—the personal will—into Nothingness—the Will of God—and had again become ready to ascend into Heaven carrying with them on their ascent their childlike nature become one with its parents.\" An age-old nightmare has been resolved once more by Philosophers who have given us back our childlike nature becoming one with its parents.\" Thus spake Episteme to his student.\"\n\n\n# The dream of Episteme.III  \nBut if you would ascend into Heaven take a different path.

And yet we want to possess her, we want to figure her out in images, we want to understand her intellectually so that one day we may say to ourselves: Yes, I am sure now! I know Truth! For I have seen her so many times during my life: every time I went up onto high places; every time I went deep inside myself; every time she came across my path—whether as joy or pain or fear or poverty or plenty; whether she was outside me like light or deep inside me like darkness; whether she was me like night and day; whether she was everything at once; whether we were we; whether we were not we; whether we knew who we were; whether we didn't know what we were; whether there were two of us looking at each other's faces through our mind's eye; whether there were two of us looking at each other's faces through our heart's eye; whether there were two of us looking at each other's faces through our soul's eye; whether there were two of us looking at each other's faces through our spirit's eye: until finally when we vanished in the same breath and then reappeared in the same breath in which we had vanished. And when we reached such heights we knew neither who we were nor what we were doing nor why we were doing this nor where we were going nor wherefrom.\"  In short this fourth metamorphosis became possible only after Philosophers had been able to dissolve all egoism—the personal will—into Nothingness—the Will of God—and had again become ready to do Philosophy with an unegoistic mind.  We are now ready to shed our last skin which is called Egoism—the personal will—\"No more novice students!\" cried Episteme.\"No more old masters!\" cried Pythagoras.\"No more masters!\" cried Socrates.\"No more disciples!\" cried Plato. \"A new cycle is beginning.\" An age-old nightmare has been resolved once more by Philosophers who have given us back our childlike nature becoming one with its parents.\" Thus spake Episteme to his student.\"\n\n\n# The dream of Episteme.IV  \nBut if you would ascend into Heaven take a different path.

Look at that!” and he laughed gaily.\n\nBut they looked up and wondered: “Art thou one of the children that play in the wood? What callest thou thee boy? What is that over thy shoulder? Thou badest us call thee”—“Call me what you will,” said the boy.—“What is it?” asked they again.\n\n“It is a wolf,” he said, “that lieth in wait for lambs. You heard it not go away? Did you not hear its feet rustle through the dry grass behind you? Did you not hear its breath as it went by your side? It hath been there by your side ever since we came out of the wood: but we must not touch it.”\n\nAnd then they went on into the town, and all were silent: and no one spoke of the thing which had come to pass. But every one was ill at ease; none made known his joy to any other; each walked alone, and thought of his own mischance. The boy too kept close to them, and looked with eyes so wide open, that they knew not how to look away or turn their heads.\n\nAnd when they came into the market-place, then did every one shake off his mantle fast unbid. And there was silence again for a while; then did every man put on his cloak, and yet more than all others did the boy put on his—for there had happened to him what no man had happened to him all his life before. And he also put on an odd sheepskin over his arm; and thus went home with them, but he said nothing of it to any of them. And when they reached their own quarter, then did every man hide himself in like manner; only the boy sat upon a stone still looking at them with wide open eyes; till at last they went into their houses; then did he also go home; but no one knew what he had seen that day.\n\nAnd when he reached his own door, he went to the window and sat down there. And he took out his hand to reach out his arm, and beheld there upon it the marks of five fingers,—the print of the five fingers. And he became afraid, and ran to his father's place, where they were all sitting at table; and he was full of fear. And he said to them: “My dear father, I have seen a sight.”\n\nBut they looked not at him, nor at one another; they looked into the fire.\n\nThen said his father unto himself: “It is a merry man that telleth a lie.”'\n\n\nAnd at that the boy began to cry.\n\n\n# PROMETHEUS.\n\n\nAh, thou eternal summer-storm of life! I fleck now the fly from thee, now the gnat.\n\nAh, thou insatiate summer-storm of life! I fleck now the gnat from thee.\n\nHow he sang to himself, and often stopped in his singing!\n\nThe sun himself is darkened, and the stars are atilt; evermore thy eyes beam with their light, and I blink with the beam on my eyes.\n\nA cloud is drawn across me, and I feel its coolness; but no rain falls through the cloud that draws over me.\n\nMy soul is athirst for love; alas, wherefore? For love’s sake I live far from thee: why art thou not near me? Why dost thou not deign to visit me? Wouldst thou even deign to visit me once? Wouldst thou not stay away a whole night? Wouldst thou not stay away a single hour? Wouldst thou not stay away at least a moment? Wouldst thou not stay away for a little while? Ah, such delay as this is more than I can bear,—much more than I can bear! Ah! wouldest thou not stay away even for a little while? Then wouldest thou show thyself to me,—show thyself to me as thy true self,—as thy dear self,—as thy tender self,—as thy sweet self:—then should I know thee at all! O dearest One! we must remain silent: we must remain still: we must remain invisible: we must let Time go by: we must wait!: we must be patient: then will come the morning. And then will it be too late! For now for a little while there is still night and darkness.—Ah, dearest One! we must remain silent: we must remain still: we must remain invisible: we must let Time go by: we must wait!: we must be patient: then will come the morning. And then will it be too late! For now for a little while there is still night and darkness.\n\n\nAh, eternal summer-storm of life! I fleck now the fly from thee, now the gnat.\n\nAh, insatiate summer-storm of life! I fleck now the gnat from thee.\n\nAnd it was as if a window were open in front of him, and he saw the world and the gay stars and the sun, and all that is high and great; and now elated with drink he lay on his back in his room and sang aloud:—\n\n\n\n\n“Room! room! Alas! The world is not for me, nor I for the world.\n\n“The world is a moon-lake that springeth up out of my heart; they who worship the moon are higher than I; for they worship my god.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE THREE VALETUDINARIAN POEMS\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nA little friend will tell its tale: (with such confiding and pensive baseness it sings to every heart; oh, they love him!) To my most dear sister he will relate all his woe; he will sing to her hissong of the house of the seven swallows. And she will take him to her bosom. And she will agree to everything that he desires to say to her; she will agree to everything that he thinks; she will agree to everything that he wishes; she will agree to everything that he does; she will agree to everything that he leaves undone; she will agree to everything that he forgets; she will agree to everything that he remembers. Oh, never does this friend let anyone else know anything about himself; but always hides himself away in some corner of his heart like a jewel, and gives himself up utterly unto her, utterly unto her alone. And therefore does his friend love him,—his sister loves him,—and all who love him love his sister,—and she loves them,—and they love her,—and she loves them,—and they love her,—and so there is complete unity among them all. And this one soul which is so closely bound up with another soul can indeed nevermore go out into life completely isolated or alone: but it always draws its brother after it, whatever course it may take. For try as it may to escape from its brother, its brother follows after it with secret attachment, wherever it may go. And though one half of the body cannot draw the other half of it along with it into eternity while yet in this world without drawing it along with it into eternity, yet surely there is no harm in drawing one's own half along with oneself towards God when He has drawn one's whole self along with oneself into eternity? For there are two kinds of death which are certainly not more opposed to one another than are this present life and eternity. But this present life is what we understand better than eternity, because we can see its beginning and end here below. Yet still does God's word remain true: “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory” (2 Corinthians 4:17). The present light seems indeed but a little thing in comparison with eternity; though in itself it has no comparison at all or even by way of likeness. How much greater then should be our joy when at last we see face to face with Him who is our true light both now here below and evermore beyond! “My flesh also shall see His salvation” (Isaiah 25:6).\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe night-bird singing in the coverts of my heart calls forth in me also wild songs: my soul becometh a bird that cannot fly, but that fluttereth among the branches without being able indeed to rest in them.—But wherefore can I not sing like him? Why am I not altogether winged? Why am I not entirely free from earth? O dearest soul! wherefore art thou not free from earth? Wherefore wingest thou thy flightless spirit? O simple soul! wherefore dost thou labour so sorely? Wherefore art thou not wholly fled? Wherefore art thou not wholly free? O dearest soul! wherefore haltest thou upon the ground? O simple soul! wherefore considerest thou thy Creator? He feedeth thee more than a thousand pairs of wings could carry you off into heaven: He feedeth thee more than ten thousand brooks could carry you off into everlasting light: He feedeth thee more than ten thousand seasons can bring unto thee eternally new joys,—O simple child! why dost thou need wings if thou art not afraid of heights? Why dost thou need flight if thou art not giddy at length? Why dost thou need earth if thou art already fled away beneath the sky?\n\n\nTo fancy that our happiness lies in aught else than fulfilling the commands of God is false; to imagine that it lies in idleness and in refraining from the government of our thoughts is foolish. O that man's reason were in reality a sister of his soul; O that it were abundantly true, there should be no more dispute between us! O that we were at years of discretion with one accord, without one difference and without any ill-will!—my steps would be well; the sky above me, the earth beneath me and with joy my voice should call forth: Alleluia! I have fashioned nothing with my reason,—I have thought that I was serving it as hers without doubt she did her master. I have discovered thereby whatever was hidden, I have hidden not even one thing that it behoved me to discover; and because it is not worth while to make use of it to know what we are, or to see what we need, I have left my fancy to itself, I have perforce led the captive reason to add nothing to the self-sufficient soul.\n\n\nPage 108\n\n\nTherefore should God Himself be my happiness, because I find Him to be the only thing that is a right reason, as we have well known. Wherefore He should be rightly accounted the profit and food of all things that exist, and He compriseth in Himself all that they contain, while they do not contain Him. To none of them is He subject and present, but in such sort that no created thing can contain Him, only, when passing over the fountain of His all-filling charity, He breaks from the bonds, namely, the good of the created thing.\"\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n\"Neither, beloved, does this please me that all things should be seen in Him, since there is provided no way, whereby I may learn whether indeed God is the cause of every best operation.\"\n\n\nTHE MONK.\n\n\n\"May I also be permitted to say something, because I see some things advanced which require to be qualified? Namely, that something was said respecting the disagreement between me and the worthy supervisor, and the investigation of which I have just finished. This disagreement, honorable citizens, is something still pending between me and him. And, to tell the godly truth, he has been too generous to our angry mood in the other world. Something has been mentioned respecting oaths sworn by our worthy supervisor before God, something which is not well known here in this world, and which I should like in my decision to have somewhat heard also. Namely, you shall know, to wit, that this worthy supervisor wanted to prevent me from accomplishing my aim which I have from the Lord God, that I should observe in my own person the entire Rule of St. Francis, especially chapter nine, wherein the servant of God shall have nought, and shall neither own anything nor have anything to do with anything, but shall apply himself with all his strength and his soul to the contemplation of the Eternal Beatitude, and to adoration, and to the transcendant peace which the good sons of God enjoy before Their Creator and Lord. Now, this worthy supervisor wished to keep me from my high vocation, which comes from my Creator; and, sirs, I was unwilling to commit a mortal sin, one that would have brought me before God with all the penalty of such a mortal sin, with the penance in the other world and with all its like painful penalties, and to enter into the ranks of that perjured, atrocious smiter with stone,10 someone who is clad in seals and unlawful enmity and is a lover of following his own will and by so doing continually violates a sworn oath and betrays the duty of honor, but which duty forces all to treat and observe what has been sworn to and obligated, unlike this evil flesh which is hostile to God,\n\nand seeks its own ends, so that the first premises are to be thwarted, that is the will of God; the works of God, therefore, were practically occasion for me to sin. But my will sought to be its own end, this object did not belong to reason, but inspired it to seek the impossible. My will, however, wished to make an end in the sense in which it conceived of its object. This is not necessarily the case.\n\nGod has given strength to acquire glory, hence a will concerning it. By extinguishing zeal, by weakening the movement of the soul, or by suffering a decline of zeal when it again becomes intense, one forfeits the glory.\n\n\nThose who have been deprived of (their) zeal (flatus indignationis) for chastisements, shall scarcely merit glory. I say scarcely, since the humble soul may merit 40 the means of meriting the grace of zeal (mens excitandi pietatem), whether in praesenti (latouri) or in voto.\n\n\n(Precious) souls may beseech their Spouse, Lord, restore to me what I have lost by my own fault! And the words of the 41 prophet meet the requests of all: Judge me, O Lord, my God, according to thy justice and let enemies not be able to triumph over me! O let them not rejoice over me, who hath raised himself up against me! Let them not say, \"we have trampled him under our feet.\" Let all that have hoped in thee, rejoice and be glad in thee and let them say always: the Lord be magnified! Let them who have loved thy salvation, say continually the Lord be multiplied over those who favour themselves and show zeal for thee (Ps. XXXIX v. Part. 1 et 2) that is over all Christian souls, who, with great zeal defend the cause of Christ and of his Church.\n\n\n(Contrite hearts) cannot obey the precept of going forth as fervent instruments active for the justice of God, if they do not obey the suggestion of entering within themselves; and therein perceiving their own poverty (they) may enter into the fulness of the Blessed Trinity and the vivifying virtue thereof, as it is said in Psalm LXIX (deus inhiti): \"Come in to him let the ungodly perish in the presence of God.\" The bridge will be broken that these may be able to cross, and they shall walk the strait road wherein they shall know themselves to be poor, were it were possible to feed their souls, after the saying of Jesus Crucified, \"he who walketh in the right way, will keep down his soul and give food to those that go"

It is a second-order accurate method. It is based on the following observations:\n\nThe spatial derivative is approximated by a central difference.\n\nThe time derivative is approximated by a forward difference.\n\nThe initial conditions are given by the values at $t=0$.\n\nThis gives the following update formula for the Leapfrog method:\n\n$$u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \\Delta t \\frac{u^{n+1}_{i+1} - u^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x}$$\n\nThe update formula uses the value at $t=n+1$ on the right-hand side, which is not known. We can solve this by starting the update at $t=1$ instead of $t=0$. This means that we have to use the forward difference on the left-hand side, and the central difference on the right-hand side.\n\n$$u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \\Delta t \\frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x}$$\n\nThis is known as a *leapfrog* scheme. It is second-order accurate in space and time, which is the same as the Lax-Friedrichs scheme.\n\nFor the second-order Runge-Kutta scheme, we have the following update:\n\n$$u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \\Delta t \\frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x} + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2 \\Delta x^2} \\left( u^n_{i+1} - 2 u^n_i + u^n_{i-1} \\right)$$\n\nThis is known as a *leapfrog-RK2* scheme. It is second-order accurate in space and time, but it is not stable.\n\nFor the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme, we have the following update:\n\n$$u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \\Delta t \\frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x} + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2 \\Delta x^2} \\left( u^n_{i+1} - 2 u^n_i + u^n_{i-1} \\right) + \\frac{\\Delta t^3}{6} \\left( \\frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{\\Delta t^3}{6} \\left( \\frac{u^n_{i+2} - u^n_{i-2}}{4 \\Delta x} \\right)^2$$\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-29 21.34.43 - Paradoxal symmetry by Escher.png]]\n\nWe can also write this in a more compact form by defining\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{u}^n_i &= u^n_i + \\Delta t \\frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x} + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2 \\Delta x^2} \\left( u^n_{i+1} - 2 u^n_i + u^n_{i-1} \\right) \\\\\nu^{n+1}_i &= \\tilde{u}^n_i + \\frac{\\Delta t^3}{6} \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{u}^n_{i+1} - \\tilde{u}^n_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) - \\frac{\\Delta t^4}{12} \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{u}^n_{i+1} - 2 \\tilde{u}^n_i + \\tilde{u}^n_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right)\n\\end{align}$$\n\nWe can see that the first term in the final line is the same as the first term in the first line, with the only difference being that we have used the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ instead of the original estimate $u^n_i$.  The second term in the final line is the same as the second term in the first line, with the only difference being that we have used the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ instead of the original estimate $u^n_i$.  This is the same as the Taylor series expansion for the linear advection equation.  The third term in the final line is the same as the third term in the first line, with the only difference being that we have used the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ instead of the original estimate $u^n_i$.  This is the same as the Taylor series expansion for the linear advection equation.  Therefore, we have a fourth-order accurate approximation for the linear advection equation.\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-29 21.39.12 - Paradoxal symmetry in the monkey universe by Picasso.png]]\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ is the same as the estimate $u^{n+1}_i$ after the first step.  Therefore, the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ is a fourth-order accurate approximation for the linear advection equation.  This means that we can use the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ as the initial condition for the next time step, rather than using the original estimate $u^n_i$.  We can then use the original estimate $u^n_i$ as the initial condition for the time step after the next time step.  We can repeat this process, alternating between using the improved estimate $\\tilde{u}^n_i$ and the original estimate $u^n_i$ as the initial condition for the next time step.  This is the idea behind the leapfrog method.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-29 21.40.39.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 21.12.36 - Love within a mathematical paradox, painting by Escher.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-27 21.56.15.png]]\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-27 21.54.14 - A mathematical paradox in the space station, painting by Escher.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-26 22.05.35.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-26 22.04.20 - An infinite mirror reflecting brains, painting by Escher.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-26 21.56.20 - An infinity mirror, painting by Escher.png]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-07-26 21.53.37 - An infinite camera portal, painting by Escher.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220326203126.png]]\n![[TimeToDisco(0)_0.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(0)_1.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_0 (1).png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_0.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_1.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_2.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_3 (1).png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(1)_3.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(2)_0.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(2)_1.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(2)_2.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(3)_0.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(3)_1 (1).png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(3)_1.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(3)_2.png]]\n\n![[TimeToDisco(3)_3.png]]"

The air hung thick and heavy with an unfamiliar scent, as the group of giraffes came cautiously towards the zoo. This was the first time any of them had seen a human before.\n\n![a giraffe in the style of a Chagall window](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/091abe7f-2486-40fc-a1d8-de55107b8b4d)\n\nThe giraffes were a little nervous, but they kept their heads held high as they entered the zoo. They had heard stories of the strange creatures that lived here, and they were eager to see them for themselves.\n\n![kids fantasy sketch a giraffe on a house roof, fantasy, intricate, epic lighting, cinematic composition, hyper realistic, 8 k resolution, unreal engine 5, by artgerm, tooth wu, dan mumford, beeple, wlop, rossdraws, james jean, marc simonetti, artstation ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0c42b4d4-7cd3-4be2-80c8-57c9452d6591)\n\n\nThe giraffes were greeted by an excited crowd of humans. They were amazed at the sight of the long-necked animals. The giraffes were equally entranced by the humans, and they watched as the humans played, laughed, and interacted with each other.\n\n![a giraffe in the style of a Chagall window](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/091abe7f-2486-40fc-a1d8-de55107b8b4d)\n\nThe giraffes were able to get close to some of the humans, and they were delighted when the humans fed them treats. The giraffes were especially fond of the colorful fruits that were given to them.\n\n![Giraffes getting stuck in a revolver door](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/122aabff-ab7a-41af-aa0f-3c91e5332dc8)\n\n\nThe giraffes stayed for several hours, and eventually, the sun started to set. The giraffes said their goodbyes to the humans, and slowly, but surely, they made their way back to their home on the red sands of Mars\n\n\n![[1671445898102_The_giraffes_stayed_for_several_hours__and_eventually__the_sun_started_to_set__The_giraffes_said_the.jpg]]\n\n\n\nGiraffes walking on the surface of Mars is a prompt for stable diffusion. While the prospects of Mars colonization are still a distant dream, the idea of the majestic animals peacefully roaming its terrain is quite captivating. The idea of these large creatures with their long necks and gangly legs traversing the arid and rocky red Martian surface is a thought that brings about a sense of stability and peace. The image of the giraffes walking through the Martian landscape, their long necks swaying in the air, is a beautiful one that could bring hope and inspiration to many.\n\n\n![[1671297939446_Giraffes_walking_on_the_surface_of_Mars_is_a_prompt_for_stable_diffusion__While_the_prospects_of_Mar.jpg]]\n\n\n\n\n"

He is known for his writings, which include the Confessions, The City of God, and On Free Choice of the Will. Augustine was born in the Roman province of Numidia and was educated in Carthage. After his conversion to Christianity, he became a bishop of the Church in Hippo, where he wrote many of his works. Augustine's writings have had an immense influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of faith and reason, original sin, grace, and predestination. He is also known for his anti-Pelagianism, which argued against the belief that humans are able to achieve salvation through their own merit. His influence continues to this day, as his works remain widely read and studied.\n\n\n"

He proposed that all of reality, both physical and mental, is part of a single substance that he called God or Nature. He argued that God and Nature are not separate entities, but rather one and the same. He believed that everything in the universe is a part of this single substance, and that all of the universe is a part of God. Spinoza's philosophy also focused on the idea of freedom and determinism, and he proposed that while humans have the ability to choose their actions, their will is ultimately determined by God. He also believed that all of our actions are predetermined by God, and that there is no real free will.\n\n\n\n![a vibrant ultraclear sideview waist up portrait of futuristoc jesus by rene magritte and laurie greasley, etching by gustave dore, colorful flat surreal, ethereal, intricate, sharp focus, illustration, highly detailed, digital painting, concept art, masterpiece ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/015f2a6f-1b0f-47f0-96f4-3ccaa59b762c)\n\n\n"

Participants are asked to say whatever comes into their mind as they complete the task. This might include what they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives observers insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. In a formal research protocol, all verbalizations are transcribed and then analyzed. In a [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing \"Usability testing\") context, observers are asked to take notes of what participants say and do, without attempting to interpret their actions and words, and especially noting places where they encounter difficulty. Test sessions may be completed on participants own devices or in a more controlled setting.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-1) Sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-2)\n\n## History\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\n\nThe think-aloud method was introduced in the usability field by Clayton Lewis[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-3) while he was at [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), and is explained in *Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction* by Lewis and John Rieman.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-4) The method was developed based on the techniques of [protocol analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis \"Protocol analysis\") by K. Ericsson and H. Simon.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-7) However, there are some significant differences between the way Ericsson and Simon propose that protocols be conducted and how they are actually conducted by usability practitioners, as noted by Ted Boren and Judith Ramey. [\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-8) These differences arise from the specific needs and context of usability testing; practitioners should be aware of these differences and adjust their method to meet their needs while still collecting valid data. For example, they may need to prompt for additional information more often than Ericsson and Simon would allow, but should take care not to influence what participants say and do.\n\n## Process\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Process\")\\]\n\nA typical procedure of think-aloud protocols would include:\n\n-   **Design the study and write the guide:** Determine the number and type of participant for the study. Generally 5 participants would be sufficient.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-9) The next step is to write a guide that ask the participants to complete the tasks intended with clear step-by-step instructions. In the script, there should be reminders to participants to say their thoughts out when performing tasks.\n-   **Recruit participants:** The team should set up a screener for eligibility of participants. After contacting the person of interest and setting up meeting details such as time and location, the team could also provide additional information to help participant better prepare for the activity.\n-   **Conduct think-aloud protocol:** After stating the purpose and asking for consent, the team should proceed by giving instructions to the participant. Ask open-ended questions and follow-up questions. The team should avoid asking leading questions or giving clues.\n-   **Analyze the findings and summarize insights:** The team should use notes taken during the sessions to generate insights and to find common patterns. Based on the findings, the design team could then decide directions to take action on.\n\nAs Kuusela and Paul[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-10) state, the think-aloud protocol can be distinguished into two different types of experimental procedures. The first is the concurrent think-aloud protocol, collected during the task. The second is the retrospective think-aloud protocol, gathered after the task as the participant walks back through the steps they took previously, often prompted by a video recording of themselves. There are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, but in general a concurrent protocol may be more complete, while a retrospective protocol has less chance to interfere with task performance.\n\n## Benefits\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Benefits\")\\]\n\nThe think-aloud method allows researchers to discover what users genuinely think of your design.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_note-:0-11)\n\n## \\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Related Method\")\\]\n\nA related but slightly different data-gathering method is the **talk-aloud protocol**. This involves participants only describing their actions but not other thoughts. This method is thought to be more objective in that participants merely report how they go about completing a task rather than interpreting or justifying their actions (see the standard works\\[*[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words \"Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words\")*\\] by Ericsson & Simon).\\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*\\]\n\n## See also\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: See also\")\\]\n\n-   [Comparison of usability evaluation methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods \"Comparison of usability evaluation methods\")\n-   [Partial concurrent thinking aloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_concurrent_thinking_aloud \"Partial concurrent thinking aloud\")\n-   [Protocol analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_analysis \"Protocol analysis\")\n-   [Retrospective think aloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_think_aloud \"Retrospective think aloud\")\n-   [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging \"Rubber duck debugging\")\n\n## References\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Think_aloud_protocol&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol#cite_ref-1 \"Jump up\")** Mclaughlin, Matthew; Duff, Jed; McKenzie, Tom; Campbell, Elizabeth; Sutherland, Rachel; Wiggers, John; Wolfenden, Luke (2021-07-26).

One may be risk loving yet completely averse to ruin. The central asymmetry of life is: In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risks of ruin.

The first step is to assess how you are feeling. Are you feeling anxious, excited, scared, or overwhelmed? Identifying your feelings can help you to understand why you are feeling a certain way and can provide insight into your motivations for making a particular decision. Once you have identified your feelings, it is important to take some time to reflect on the potential outcomes of the decision. Consider the consequences of your decision and how it may affect your life, relationships, or career. Finally, once you have taken the time to assess your emotions and potential outcomes, trust your intuition and make a decision that is right for you.\n\nYou should also consider [[Second-Order Thinking|second-order effects]] that will result from this decision.\n\n\n# External links\n\nThese uses reversible decisions:\nKnowledge Project #147 (PayPal founder)\nKnowledge Project Stripe CEO\nBezos\n\n"

There is no learning without having to pose a question. And a question requires doubt. People search for certainty. But there is no certainty. People are terrified — how can you live and not know? It is not odd at all. You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don't know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know.\n>~ [[Feynman]]\n\nBob is a young hunter-gatherer with basic understanding of the world, he saw, hunted and ate white swans.\nHis map of the territory comprises white swans, as delicious bird easy to catch.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220528210350.png]]\n\nBut it seems many people assume their map is complete? If you don't know that your map is full of holes, you are dead.\n\n>When they think that they know the answers, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don’t know, people can find their own way.\n>~ [[Lao Tze]]\n\nOne must be aware [[Plato's allegory|that our senses do not reflect reality]], thus, we cannot always merely rely on these inputs, you have to think beyond our limitations.\n\n>Recall that the neocortex is constantly making predictions. Predictions are how the brain tests whether its model of the world is correct; an incorrect prediction indicates something is wrong with the model and needs to be fixed.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\nIt is (most of the time, see evolutionary thoughts below) an optimal strategy to try to revision your map of the territory.\n\n## Language is the map\n\n>Obviously there's some causal relation between what's outside in the world and what's in our head. But it does not follow that there's a symbol–object relationship, [something like the reverse of the causal one]. And the big problem with that approach is – what's the object?\n>~ [[Noam Chomsky]]\n\n\n## Phantom in the brains are maps that don't reflect the territory\n\n[[Ramachandran]] wrote a book studying people who lost a limb but their map still shows a territory including the limb.\n\n>The model can be wrong. For example, people who lose a limb often perceive that the missing limb is still there. The brain’s model includes the missing limb and where it is located. So even though the limb no longer exists, the sufferer perceives it and feels that it is still attached. The phantom limb can “move” into different positions.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n\n## The [[Brain]] is full of maps, called \"reference frame\"\n\n>**We deduced that the neocortex stores everything we know, all our knowledge, using something called reference frames. I will explain this more fully later, but for now, consider a paper map as an analogy**. A map is a type of model: a map of a town is a model of the town, and the grid lines, such as lines of latitude and longitude, are a type of reference frame.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n>We realized that the brain’s model of the world is built using maplike reference frames. Not one reference frame, but hundreds of thousands of them. Indeed, we now understand that most of the cells in your neocortex are dedicated to creating and manipulating reference frames, which the brain uses to plan and think.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n## What your emotions is not necessarily a map that reflect the territory\n\nIt is often believed that the more [[Rationality|rational]] the map, the least [[Emotion|emotion]]s he has, it is not true.\nThe rational man knows when to use his emotions, when not. These signals fine-tuned by an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] process in our ancestral environment are not necessarily in our modern world, a bag of sugar was scarce in the past, now it is abundant. A bag of [[Information|information]] was scant, now it is plentiful.\n\n## Measuring maps\n\nImagine I say Bob's map is very different from Henry's map, but Bob thinks his map his very close to Henry's map. Who to believe? Also do you need a map to measure maps? Isn't it [[Infinite recursion]]?\n\nHow do you know and measure one's map closeness to the territory? I doubt we have the technology or maths to do that yet, at least not for [[Philosophy/Rationality/Intelligence|organic intelligence]], we can do that with [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] though.\n\n## False belief can be an evolutionary optimal strategy\n\n>False models of the world can spread and thrive as long as the false beliefs help the believers spread their genes. The history book and the people who believe it are in a symbiotic relationship. They help each other replicate, and they evolve over time in a mutually reinforcing way. The history book may be factually incorrect, but life is not about having a correct model of the world. Life is about replication.\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\n## [[Getting stuck in local minima]]\n\n## [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Falsifiability|Falsification]]\n\nI never considered the map heuristic possibly wrong, but actually some people believe this, let's try to put ourselves in their mind:\n\n[[Anti representationalism]] says that the map of the territory metaphor is invalid\n\n\n# Links\n\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/tag/map-and-territory\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgP9MUFGNuk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQsnHkfs3sA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nSimilar topic links:\n\n[[Mapping maps]]\n[[Getting stuck in local minima]]\n"

Actors who hung out there gossiping about other actors discovered that Broadway shows that lasted for, say, one hundred days, had a future life expectancy of a hundred more. For those that lasted two hundred days, two hundred more. The heuristic became known as the Lindy effect.* [[Nassim Taleb]]\n\n*The idea of the Lindy effect is itself Lindy-proof. The pre-Socratic thinker Periander of Corinth wrote, more than twenty-five hundred years ago: Use laws that are old but food that is fresh.

He'll hold up a flower and say \"look how beautiful it is,\" and I'll agree. Then he says \"I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,\" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? **All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower**. It only adds.

            "note_content": "\nWe're all animals, basically human society is a Zoo. A free animal in a zoo is actually quite free, but when it lives in a cage its freedom is greatly restricted. Similarly, when it lives in human society, being still basically a wild animal, it is actually free to live according to its own nature. It can live in harmony with others. It can live in harmony with Nature. It can live in harmony with the Divine, but when imprisoned within the limits of human society, it loses all freedom.\n\nLet us imagine that we are children again, just born into the world, without any knowledge or experience whatsoever. We are like animals in the forest. We do not know anything about what is outside us; we do not know how to catch what there is to catch; we do not even know what there is to catch; we simply move about and attempt to satisfy our desires and cravings. That is how we move through life—uttering cries for food, for love, for other things which do not exist—thus causing pain and suffering to ourselves and to other people around us! And that is how we grow up, that is how we come out of childhood? No! That is not how children grow up or become adults.\n\nThere is a great deal of difference between the life of a child and the life of an adult. To become an adult one must cease to be a child; one must grow beyond the needs and demands of the ordinary mind. And that is why, as I said, children are such a nuisance. They often represent what we most need to be rid of. That is why we say that children ought to be made to study. They ought to study mathematics and physics and chemistry and biology and so on: these sciences, which means pressure and demand and competition, afford them exactly the opportunity they need for developing themselves out of their childhood. This is what we mean by education—education, that is to say, learning through pressure and demand and competition. We all know how many children there are in the world who have never learnt anything at all! If instead of teaching them something useless—something which does not help them in their normal existence—we taught them something useful—science for example, then they would grow up much quicker than those who go to school or learn from books or from parents or lecture-rooms.\n\nLook, listen to all this, listen to all the noise that is going on in the world. Don’t take sides, don’t jump to any conclusions, but just listen. Don’t say one noise is better than another noise; they are all noises, so just listen first. And listen also to your own noise, your chattering, your wishes\n\nI want to be this and I don’t want to be that’—and find out what it means to listen. Find out, don’t be told. Discuss it with me and find out what it means first. Find out what it means to think, why you think, what is the background of your thinking. Watch yourself, but don’t become self-centered in that watching. Be tremendously concerned, in watching, about further enlargement of yourself and your consciousness. Be very watchful and alert and silent, but at the same time be intensely serious and attentive. And whatever the state of consciousness you are in, whatever the thought you may be thinking or feeling, whatever the mood you may be in, be careful not to obscure your consciousness.\n\nWhence comes all this noise? Where does it come from? It comes from the dark well of the unconscious mind. And man does not know what is down there. What he knows is only a small fraction of what is there. There is something much deeper than that which has come up and expressed itself on the surface, and that too is very much simpler and unspoiled than what we think we know.\n\nAs I was saying, whenever we rise above our animal nature and become conscious,—not just conscious, but conscious at a much higher level than that which is normally called our consciousness—there come into our being thoughts from a different source from our normal thoughts. There are thoughts from another source, from a deeper source, from a broader source. In other words, if we keep on rising towards higher levels of consciousness, one after another, there will come a time when we find within us a place where things come into our awareness from another world—the world of the Spirit.\n\nEverything that moves us, all that attracts us or repels us—and it moves us not only in the physical field but also in the vital field and even beyond—all that moves us can be called a movement of grace or an influence from another being or being known as God or from another being known as Satan or Antichrist or whatever you please! There is no difference between them as far as it goes. But if you keep on rising towards higher levels you will find out as you go up, as you rise higher and higher—I have spoken to you about these things before—there comes into your mind other ideas and other thoughts which are not your normal thoughts: they have been given to you by a power which is beyond your normal self-consciousness. It is a power which seeks to lead you to a knowledge of the Divine beyond your normal self-consciousness; otherwise it would not seek to do so; it would descend upon your normal consciousness; it would put its own ideas into your mind; it would make such things appear before your eyes which are useful for its purpose and serve its purpose; but for human beings like yourself there must come always something else! You must know then that these supernal influences do not always enter into the mental field; they can enter into other realms also where they express themselves differently and differently because of their essence and origin.\n\nIt is for this reason that I tell you, take care not to let yourself be guided by what you find in your mind, but rather let it be the guidance of the Divine. It makes no difference to you whether you follow after a mental guide or a Divine Guide. If you follow after the Divine Guide, you will not only gain, but your gain will be much bigger than if you follow after the human guide. You will gain much more than if you follow after the mind—for the mind has its tricks and devices and is full of trickery, it is full of dilettante, arbitrary opinions; but if you follow behind the Divine Guide, then there are no more dilettantes, no more opinions based upon your own ideas; everything becomes simple and transparent because behind all there is simplicity itself—benevolence itself,—the Will of the Divine,—a Power which does not leave us in doubt or hesitation or anything else. That is how we should proceed.\n\nTHERE are many ways of escaping pain. You can escape pain by being an ascetic or becoming a saint or by engaging in some religious activity. Some people escape pain by resort to drugs or alcohol or whatever they happen to choose at the time. Others think that it is possible to avoid pain altogether. They think that there is no pain in the world; they say all is good and all is beautiful, and they are always happy. But I tell you that it is not possible to escape pain altogether.\n\nTry to learn how to avoid taking drugs, alcohol or whatever you like, but do not try to avoid suffering. You must take it; if necessary, you must even welcome it; only on the other hand, you must know how to do this. If you know how to avoid suffering then you will create more suffering for yourself than if you try to avoid it. If you know how to avoid suffering then you will be creating still more suffering for yourself than if you try to avoid it. And so with pleasure. You must know how not to take pleasure in it, but welcome it even when it comes. But without being disturbed by it. And so with any kind of suffering or pleasure, physical or mental. Up above there are states of consciousness which are beyond all these things that come into our mind or into our being—states of consciousness which are far beyond mental consciousness where everything is pure light, where everything is peace and harmony, where there is no trouble or misery or suffering at all! There are better ways of escaping pain than the way I am telling you here. But if you want to escape from your animal nature, if you want to escape from your environment in order to be in harmony with the Divine consciousness, I tell you very clearly: this is the thing to do. It may not be the easiest way for your body, but it is absolutely essential for your soul.\"\n\nEDUCATION is one of our greatest blessings today when everything else seems to be against us when everything else seems bent on making us fail in our duty towards society. It seems as if our whole education has been directed towards making us fail in our duty towards society and towards ourselves. It seems as if we have been made into mere machines and that we were taught only how to become machines and lose all our original nature. But the truth is that we were never taught how to become machines; we were taught how to become citizens of the world; we were taught how to become good citizens of the world. We were never taught how to become ignorant and useless beings who do not know what to do with their lives, who have no purpose in life or who have no real need of any purpose in life.\n\nWe have been given a wonderful education that will make you a perfect citizen of the world, a perfect citizen of science and of humanity. I am not talking of a political ideal, but a human ideal. It is by such an education that one becomes a true man, a true woman, a true citizen, a true being. If you want to be great you must rise by such an education.\n\nBut if you wish to be great something else is required, something else must be taught you: the science of the Spirit. And that is the only way that will secure for you a future which will not bring disaster on you or on mankind. You must know then that all happiness or all pleasure is a result of ignorance and egoism—the ego has taken possession of everything. All pleasures are harmful because they obscure your vision, they disable your vision. The same principles apply here as in the physical world: these principles must be applied on this higher level also, otherwise you will continue in your ignorance and pain and suffering and evil which come from ignorance and egoism.\n\nThere is no doubt about it: there are many ways of escaping pain: there are many ways which succeed in sparing us from pain but fail to give us real joy or real pleasure or happiness for which we really long because these ways are always based upon ignorance and egoism; they are only means; they are not ends; they are not ideals leading us to what we really seek for,—what you call heaven or nirvana or whatever it may be called,—they are very good means but not ideals.\n\nA leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.\nThe wisdom of the sage is to investigate the world and its mysteries, and then to go and preach about it—not to become a teacher.\nIf your desires are not extravagant, they will be granted.\nIf you know how to be satisfied, you will never be miserable.\nThe mind unlearns with difficulty what it has long learned.\nWhen you understand what the problem is, the solution becomes easy.\nWhen you are content, you are happy.\nWhen you reach beyond yourself, you become the world.\nHe who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who thinks great thoughts, often makes great errors.\nHe who is contented is rich.\nHe who follows virtue will never be poor.\nHe who has lost his peace of mind is dead to the world.\nOppression can indeed make one great.\n\nThe Spirit is the only reality: the world and all the appearances of the world are but its play and shadow and mirror. Therefore in order to be happy you must let go of yourself and abandon yourself to that which is beyond all change and passing, which is always here and already has taken possession of us.\n\nTo be perfectly free from attachment to desires and passions and desires, to be perfectly calm and detached from all these things, these things must be completely rejected; all this must be put away; we must not allow ourselves to be governed by them in any way. Then we will find ourselves having quite easily a life in harmony with the Divine, in accordance with His will: we shall find ourselves in a life full of joy and pleasure and peace and happiness, because our whole being is unified with that which is behind; because our whole being becomes one with that which is beyond,—a perfect unison,—the Divine Consciousness itself. All our desires will come down to nothingness like drops of water in a heavy shower; it will be like seas without a storm because there will no longer be any movement upon the surface of life, everything will have reached its goal or achieved its purpose, everything will have been fulfilled.\"\n\nIT IS a very interesting study, this law of attraction between two souls. It is said that there are souls which are mirrors of one another, souls that attract each other mutually without even knowing it, because they have been created for each other. In fact each soul has been created for itself alone: it has no need to attract or repel anybody or anything, it simply exists! But when two souls happen to meet together in their ignorance or forgetfulness or ignorance even, then a strange thing happens: it seems as if they were made for each other! The two souls automatically feel attracted towards one another, they feel a necessity to meet again and again though they do not know why they feel so attracted towards one another. They think they have found something special in each other which fills them with an inexhaustible desire for more meetings again and again. Now if two souls meet together not knowing each other but accidentally or by chance then one immediately feels that this meeting was meant for him by the Divine Grace: the soul sees clearly that this meeting was arranged by the Divine Grace for his own protection; he feels certain that if he does not keep it up he may not be able to keep out of danger; he may even lose his way or be killed or lose his health or die soon;"

This law was named after British economist Charles Goodhart, who first formulated it in 1975. It has since been used to explain the ineffectiveness of certain economic policies, and to suggest that policymakers should be wary of relying too heavily on a single indicator to measure the success of their policies. Goodhart's law is important because it warns policymakers of the dangers of relying too heavily on a single indicator or metric when making economic decisions. It emphasizes the importance of considering the wider context when designing economic policies.\n\n>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\n\n- https://openai.com/blog/measuring-goodharts-law/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"

The “[[Halo effect]]” is a term used to describe the idea that people’s general perception of one’s appearance can influence their overall opinion of that person. People tend to form a positive opinion of someone if they are seen as fashionable and stylish. On the flip side, people may also form a negative opinion of someone if they appear to be out of fashion or unkempt. Therefore, fashion can have a huge impact on how people perceive us and how we perceive ourselves. When we look good, we feel good, and this can have a positive effect on our self-esteem.\n"

His wife says, ‘For God’s sake, stop all that tommy-rot and lead a different kind of life’. So there is a division between the two—even though they may sleep together.

It is not my invention, you can watch it. You see a lovely sunset, and later you say, ‘I wish I could go back there and see it again’. At the moment of seeing that sunset, there was no pleasure. You saw something extraordinary, full of light and colour and depth.

Would it not be better to give **death** the place in actuality and in our thoughts which properly belongs to it, and to yield a little more prominence to that unconscious attitude towards **death** which we have hitherto so carefully suppressed?

We can envisage a utopia wherein people will have such long lives that the fear of death will drop away, and with it the fiendish drivenness that has haunted man so humiliatingly and destructively all through his history and now promises to bring him total self-defeat.

Buss]] says that displaying conscientiousness is again signalling for the sake of mating?\n\n>Verbal dexterity (a large and fluent vocabulary and facility with language and its nuances), intelligence, artistic ability, musicality, and creativity. **Even displaying moral virtues such as honesty, cooperativeness, fairness, and conscientiousness can be signals.** The fitness signaling hypothesis draws an analogy with the peacock’s tail—the tail is flashy, cumbersome, and costly, but only peacocks in the best condition, those with the highest fitness, can afford to produce these mesmerizing displays.\n\n\n## Short-term mating used to be long-term valuable in the ancestral environment\n\n>**The old brain, schooled by natural selection over millions of years when sugar was scarce and valuable for survival, says, “Cake. Want cake. Mmmm cake. Gimme.”** The new brain, schooled by books and doctors over mere tens of years when sugar was over-plentiful, says, “No, no. Not cake. Mustn’t. Please don’t eat that cake.”\n>~ [[Jeff Hawkins]]\n\nIn day-to-day life if you give a kid an ice cream it will give him a shot of joy for a few minutes to the detriment of its long-term health, i.e. ir[[Rationality|rational]], but kids are ignorant so he just follow his primitive intelligence which loves sugar.\n\nIsn't it the same for short-term mating? In the ancestral environment it was interesting to practice a lot of short-term mating, for the sake of the [[Selfish gene]] but now that we have a bit more freedom over the [[Monkey Brain]], should we stick to this strategy?\n\nWhat are the benefits beyond a few hours of intense pleasure (depending on the context), considering the cost of mating (seduction, deception in a short-term strategy while suggesting a possible long-term mating, consumption of toxins such as alcohol and other drugs)?\n"

In those cases, females try to gain or defend a long-term tie with a male.

In this way they avoided being disturbed by the chimpanzee children, who are fascinated by sex, or by Oor. Oor would come rushing up to Amber on two legs, thrashing threateningly with her arms, intent on interrupting her mating session with Nikkie. At other times she would quickly present herself to Nikkie just as Amber was about to do so. Her interference only decreased after she had developed an intimate relationship of her own, with Dandy. These two young couples proved with their fondling, cuddling, and enthusiasm that chimpanzees are capable of playing with sex. This was clearest of all in the so-called \"sex dances.\"\n>~ [[Frans de de Waal - Chimpanzee Politics|Chimpanzee Politics]]\n\n### Deceptive strategies\n\n>Although women are more likely to be sexual deceivers, men are more likely to be commitment deceivers.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\nMen and women use different deceptive strategies to reach their sexual [[Personal growth/Goal|goals]].\nShort-term mating is by definition a non-iterative multiplayer game.\nAs a reminder, short-term mating strategies are optimal for the [[Monkey Brain]] which optimise decision making in spreading the [[Selfish gene]] in a wide range of mates for the male. Women are rather looking for long-term mating in order to secure a committed parent which will carry the woman genes.\n\nI suppose that in kind of game strategies like [[Tit for tat]] are poor and more defective strategies are more adapted.\n\nFor example if Bob fake its emotions to Alice in order to have sex and succeed, once he have sex, he won, he can just leave and he achieved the purpose of his life: propagate his genes.\n\n>When my lab asked 112 college men whether they had ever exaggerated the depth of their feelings for a woman in order to have sex with her, 71 percent admitted to having done so, compared with only 39 percent of the women who were asked a parallel question. When the women were asked whether a man had ever deceived them by his exaggeration of the depth of his feelings in order to have sex with her, 97 percent admitted that they had experienced this tactic at the hands of men; in contrast, only 59 percent of the men had experienced this tactic at the hands of women.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### The [[Biology/Evolution/Red Queen|Red Queen]] competition between men's short-term and women's long-term strategies\n\n### Detecting commitment\n\n>Getting a man to **express himself emotionally** represents one tactic that women use to gain access to the important information they need to discern a man’s degree of commitment.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n>One reason men fail to express their emotions is that investing less emotionally in a relationship frees up resources that can be channeled toward other women or other goals. As in many negotiable exchanges, it is often in a man’s best interest not to reveal how strong his desires are or how intensely he is willing to commit.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Physical attractiveness\n\n>Multi-decade mating studies in the United States from 1939 to 1996 found that **men rate physical attractiveness and good looks as more important and desirable in a potential mate than do women**. Men tend to see attractiveness as important, whereas women tend to see it as desirable but not very important. The gender difference in the importance of attractiveness remains constant from one generation to the next. Its size does not vary throughout the decades. Men’s greater preference for physically attractive mates is among the most consistently documented psychological sex differences.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Homosexuality as a cloning strategy\n\nFrom a more spiritual/[[Metaphysical|metaphysical]] point of view,\n\n>This brilliant speculation enables us to understand some of the ideal motives for homosexuality, not only of the Greeks, but of especially individualized and creative persons like Michelangelo. For such a one, apparently, homosexuality has nothing to do with the sex organs of the beloved but rather represents a struggle to create one’s own rebirth in the “closest possible likeness,” which, as Rank says, is obviously to be found in one’s own sex. In terms of our discussion we can see that this attempt represents the complete causa-sui project: **to create all by oneself a spiritual, intellectual, and physically similar replica of oneself: the perfectly individualized self-perpetuation or immortality symbol**.\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\nFrom a more [[Evolution|evolutionary]] point of view,\n\n>The sexologist Alfred Kinsey estimated that more than one-third of all men engage at some point in life in some form of homosexual activity.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Monogamy\n\n>Why men would ever commit to just one woman poses a puzzle. Since all an ancestral man needed to do to reproduce was to impregnate a woman, casual sex without commitment would have achieved this goal. For evolution to produce men who desire commitment or marriage and who are willing to devote years of investment to one woman, powerful adaptive advantages to that strategy over one of seeking casual sex, at least under some circumstances, must have been present.\n\n>Men also gain in two other ways by committing. One is an increase in **social status**. In many cultures, males are not considered “real men” until they have married. Increased status, of course, brings a man other bounties, including **better resources for his children** and sometimes an **increased attractiveness to additional mates**. A final benefit of commitment or marriage is the formation of a **more expansive coalitional network** that includes his spouse’s friends and kin. Men, in short, have much to gain by committing to one woman.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Wife's age is inversely proportional to wallet size\n\n>As men’s income goes up, they seek younger partners.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Male optimise for quantity, female for quality\n\n>Within the next year, for example, men stated on average that ideally they would like to have more than six sex partners, whereas women said that they would like to have only one.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n>The psychological clues that reveal men’s strategies for casual sex are numerous: sexual fantasies, the Coolidge effect, lust, sex drive, inclination to seek intercourse rapidly, relaxation of standards, attitudes toward hookups, emotions of sexual regret, the closing time effect, post-orgasm shifts in judgments of women’s attractiveness, homosexual proclivities, and willingness to use prostitution as a sexual outlet.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n### Males like diversity\n\n>\"**You don’t want to eat the same vegetable every day**.”A Kgatla man from South Africa described his sexual desires about his two wives: “I find them both equally desirable, but when I have slept with one for three days, by the fourth day she has wearied me, and when I go to the other I find that I have greater passion, she seems more attractive than the first, but it is not really so, for when I return to the latter again there is the same renewed passion.\n>~ [[David M. Buss]]\n\n\n### Having children means you've done your job, you can exit the gene pool now\n\n### [[Osho]] spiritual thoughts\n\n#metaphysical [[The value of metaphysical statements]]?\n\n>A conditional love is nothing but an infatuation, sexuality. Unconditional is the only way love can be. Wherever a condition comes in, love disappears. It cannot live in bondage, and a condition gives it an imprisonment. Love can only live like the vast sky. Love knows no boundaries.\n\n>Sexuality is possible without any understanding, without any meditation. Love is possible only with understanding. Compassion is possible only with understanding and meditation, understanding and awareness.\n\n>The meditative person can transform his sexuality without any antagonism. without any conflict. He is in deep friendship with all his energies, sexual or others; he is not in any fight. Why fight with your own energies? Love them, rejoice in them, and help them to transcend the lower forms, the animal forms. Let them move from the body towards the turiya, the fourth.\n\n>If you want to change from sex towards love, try to understand your sexuality. Watch it, watch the mechanicalness of it. See the futility, see the whole absurdity of it — it is not leading you anywhere. Become a little more refined, become a little more subtle. Look not for the body, but somebody’s being. Watch, explore. Sooner or later you will find somebody who fits with you.\n\n>Ordinarily we think sex makes people loving — sex can never make people loving. In fact, it is sexuality that prevents love from growing — because it is the same energy that has to become love. It is being destroyed in sex. To become love, the same energy has to move to the heart centre.\n\n>One has to love unconditionally — the trees and the rocks and the sun and the moon and the people.\n\n>A boyfriend or a girlfriend may be fun, but cannot become a door to the deepest that is hidden in each and everyone. With a girlfriend you can be sexually related, but love cannot grow. Love needs deep roots. Sexuality is possible on the surface, but sexuality is just animal, biological. It can be beautiful if it is part of a deeper love, but if it is not part of a deeper love it is the most ugly thing possible; the ugliest, because then there is no communion — you simply touch each other and separate. Only bodies meet, but not you — not I, not thou. This has happened in all relationships.\n\n>Love is born in sexuality but sexuality is not love. The lotus is born in the mud, but the lotus is not just mud. And if mud remains mud of course there are bound to be tears on the cheeks.\n\n>Love can exist only after meditation, not before it. That is a simple existential law. Before meditation — only lust, only sexuality. Before meditation you are an animal and not really a human being. With meditation a transformation comes: you become human, and out of your humanness, love flows.\n\n>Beware of lust, unconscious sexuality. When sex becomes conscious it has a totally different flavor. It becomes tantra, it is no longer sex. When sex becomes conscious it is love, it is no longer lust. Love brings freedom, and lust simply creates prisons for you.\n\n>Unless your sexuality rises and reaches to love it is mundane, it has nothing sacred about it. When your sex becomes love, then it is entering into a totally different dimension — the dimension of the mysterious and the miraculous. Now it is becoming religious, sacred, it is no longer profane.\n\n>Sex can be transcended and should be transcended, but transcendence has to be not against nature but with nature, Through nature. Accept your sexuality — it is part of you! and a tremendously important part. You are born out of sex. Each cell of your body is a sex cell. Sex energy is your life energy! — respect it, it is a gift from God. Understand it. Be more and more meditative about it. But drop all prejudices, drop all condemnations. because when you carry a condemnation you cannot understand a thing. Drop all judgements. Sex is sex — it is a pure natural energy. With great acceptance, love, respect, meditate over it. Go deeper and deeper into it to see what exactly it is. And in that very seeing you will be going beyond it.\n\n>The person who is free of sexuality, whose sexuality has become a transformed phenomenon, is also free of money, is also free of ambition, is also free of the desire to be famous. Immediately all these things disappear from his life. The moment sex energy starts rising upwards, the moment sex energy starts becoming love, prayer, meditation, then all lower manifestations disappear.\n\n>Love is creative. Sex is destructive. And there is a lot of difference between the two. Sometimes you start thinking that your sexuality is your love. Then you are deceived. Sexuality can play the game of love, but it is a counterfeit game. I am not against sex, but I am certainly against sexuality. And the difference is that sex is a natural thing and sexuality is a mind thing. To love a woman is natural, to love a man is natural. To reproduce children is natural, nothing wrong in it. But to think about women, to carry pornographic pictures, to fall asleep every night thinking about women — women and women and women — that is sexuality.\n\n>When you are in sexuality you don’t bother much to whom you are making love — any body will do. You just need a woman or a man, any body will do. You just need the other’s body. In love, any body won’t do, anybody’s body won’t do. You need a person who is in deep love with you, who has a certain affinity and harmony with you, in whose presence your heart starts singing, a deep bell starts ringing… in whose presence you feel a blessing. Then only is it possible for you to make love to the other person. To make love is possible only if the meeting — the inner meeting — has happened. Otherwise it is simply impossible to think, even to imagine that you are making love to a person you don’t love.\n\n>If you have really experienced the inner light, sex will disappear. Love will happen to you, but sex will disappear; sexuality will disappear. Love, a very loving personality, will take its place. There will be no desire for sex. If the desire for sex remains, you have not experienced the inner light. Then the inner light is just a projection of the mind.\n\n>A split personality can never become non-greedy. It can try, but it can never become. A split personality can never go beyond anger. It can try, but it can never go beyond. A split personality can never go beyond sex. It can fight. So many monks in the monasteries are doing it. They don’t go beyond sex; at the most their sexuality becomes perverted, their love becomes poisoned.\n\n>Remember, you can make love to a woman without any love in your heart — then it is pure sexuality, animality; it is prostitution. You can make love to a woman with no idea of sex, then love is just a pure communication of two energies, a sharing, a dance, a celebration. No idea of sex in the mind and you can make love to a woman, and the woman can make love to you not thinking of sex at all. The whole point is where your mind is. If you are thinking of sex, if your mind is obsessed with sex, you simply want to use the woman, the woman simply wants to use you, it is ugly. It has no aesthetics in it, no poetry in it. There is nothing of the beyond in it — it is very muddy.\n\n"

In the first place it refers to people who are having trouble living with the truth of existence; it is universal in this sense because everybody has some trouble living with the truth of life and pays some vital ransom to that truth.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.00.58 - A man meditating under a grayish sky harassed by bats flying around, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible he.png]]\n\n>We can see that neurosis is par excellence the danger of a symbolic animal whose body is a problem to him. Instead of living biologically, then, he lives symbolically. Instead of living in the partway that nature provided for he lives in the total way made possible by symbols. One substitutes the magical, all-inclusive world of the self for the real, fragmentary world of experience.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.02.11 - A man meditating under a grayish sky harassed by bats flying around, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible he.png]]\n\n>This apparent egocentricity originally is just a defense mechanism against the danger of reality….

He has no doubts; there is nothing you can say to sway him, to give him hope or trust. He is a miserable animal whose body decays, who will die, who will pass into dust and oblivion, disappear forever not only in this world but in all the possible dimensions of the universe, whose life serves no conceivable purpose, who may as well not have been born, and so on and so forth. He knows Truth and Reality, the motives of the entire universe.\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-08-06 20.03.04 - A man under a grayish sky full of thunder, he is strongly holding his head with both his hand, as if stroke by a terrible headache, digital art.png]]\n\n>If neurosis is sin, and not disease, then the only thing which can “cure” it is a world-view, some kind of affirmative collective ideology in which the person can perform the living drama of his acceptance as a creature.\n\n>In other words, the neurotic isolates himself from others, cannot engage freely in their partialization of the world, and so cannot live by their deceptions about the human condition. He lifts himself out of the “natural therapy” of everyday life, the active, self-forgetful engagement in it; and so the illusions that others share seem unreal to him\n\n# External links\n\n"

The Creation of Meaning - The Denial of Death\n\n  \n\nA protagonist in the Creation of Meaning series is a person who believes that we're living in what seems to be a disinterested universe, and yet is starving at an existential level.\n\n\nWe all know who I'm talking about, and while these are not funny problems to be having, they are at least pretty ironic problems to be having given the circumstances here. But we're not going to think like that, and maybe philosophy can help us find a solution.\n\n  \n\nWe've seen the ambiguity of Simone de Bevoir, the value, pluralism, and affirmation of Nietzsche, the obedience to a spiritual quest in the work of Kirkegaard, and now we're going to hear from someone who's approaching this process from a more scientific perspective.\n\n  \n\nToday, we're going to look at Ernest Becker's later work, and in particular his book called the Denial of Death. We'll ask the question of why we even care about creating a system of meaning in the first place.\n\n  \n\nBecker explains that human beings are dualistic entities, meaning that they are biological entities and symbolic entities. This dualistic relationship creates a problem that every human being experiences.\n\n  \n\nBecker says we're capable of doing some pretty incredible things, but we're also capable of getting flattened by a Mormon on a bicycle, getting stuck in an elevator, or starving to death.\n\n  \n\nHuman beings cannot function in the world while also having an awareness of their death constantly haunting them up in their minds. Ernest Becker describes the state of terror every person finds themselves in when they become aware of their own mortality.\n\n  \n\nBecker says that people experience terror because they have emerged from nothing to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, and excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression.\n\n  \n\nPeople fear death because they fear what death will say about their lives, and the things they did or didn't do while they were here on this planet.\n\n  \n\nBecker believes that when faced with the reality of death, people will find something to make them feel better. There are thousands of ways we live in denial about our death.\n\n  \n\nBecker argues that organized religion is a method people use to escape the fear of insignificance and impermanence that may come along with their death.\n\n  \n\nErnest Becker says that people who face the terror of impermanence and insignificance respond by engaging in a defiant creation of meaning, which he calls a hero's journey.\n\n  \n\nA person creates a system of values and a set of projects to try and immortalize themselves within human culture. This is why people create great works of art, why people run marathons, why people do anything other than sit around and get cheeto fingers.\n\n  \n\nBecker would be a fan of this self-aware self-realized version of this defiant creation of meaning that we've been engaged in, and he wouldn't be ashamed of using similar words to what other existentialist philosophers have used in their work.\n\n  \n\nBecker's theory of denial of death can be used to explain how human culture is a conglomeration of millions of different immortality projects all working together, and how society works by providing people with ready-made pre-molded societal roles.\n\n  \n\nBecker says that we learn to identify ourselves with the categories that our culture gives us to work with, and that these categories make us feel significant and permanent because they allow us to attach ourselves to cultural ideals.\n\n  \n\nBeing a mime answers a lot of questions I might otherwise have about my existence, and makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger than just me.\n\n  \n\nBecker would like to be clear that we need illusions, because without them we wouldn't be able to function, society wouldn't be able to continue, and most of us would live in a state of constant neurotic terror.\n\n  \n\nCulture is an illusion created by people afraid of their own insignificance and impermanence. If you're too smart for everyone, nothing will ever feel meaningful to you.\n\n  \n\nBecker would have seen this coming, because he talks about how having a good Bs detector can lead you to see through the illusions and narratives that underlie every single one of these cultural hero journeys that somebody might engage in.\n\n  \n\nYou are a dancing monkey who has decided to live by a set of constructed illusions. Use your overflowing intelligence to build a sturdy shelter for yourself that will last over the years.\n\n  \n\nWhen your culture is all that you've ever known, it's easy to miss how similar the function of religion and the function of culture really are. Culture gives people a stable identity to hold on to, just like religion gives people a purpose.\n\n  \n\nReligion and culture both give people hope of an afterlife, and both scratch the same itch at the root of human existence.\n\n  \n\nWestern society, since Newton, is still as religious as any other, because it believes that science, money, and goods make men count for more than any other animal.\n\n  \n\nBecker is not being unnecessarily hostile towards the process of culture, and would no doubt say that we should encourage more people to find a purpose for their life by immersing themselves in a culture and then providing a service that makes society better for the people around them.\n\n  \n\nBecker is trying to show us that we all have a latent fear of death, and that by showing us this fear, we can maybe learn to live alongside it.\n\n  \n\nIf you approach the study of human beings from a place of complete enlightenment-era scientific value neutrality, you might miss out on something very important about our existence. There is a part of us that is undeniably religious.\n\n  \n\nThe protagonists of this Creation and Meaning series may find it hard to connect the things they do in their life to anything that's meaningful and enduring. Ernest Becker suggests that a totally value neutral, scientific approach towards understanding human behavior may have been harmful.\n\n\n---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7GZrgWKj9o&t=2s\n\nWhen I was five years old, I realized that death was going to happen to me. To this day, I feel shudders of terror when I recall that moment.\n\nErnest Becker argued that humans have a profound fear of death, and that we spend most of our lives trying to explain, forestall, or avoid the inevitability of our own death. Sheldon Solomon has spent 30 years studying this fear.\n\nThroughout human history, theologians, philosophers, and even people sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere have tried to characterize the essence of what it means to be a human being. And one way that people have been characterized is as homo sapiens.\n\nHuman beings are also called homo ludens, homo faber, homo aestheticus, and homo narratization. I think they are all useful heuristic devices that draw our attention to different aspects of our humanity.\n\nWe propose a new designation for humans, homo mortalis, based on Alexander Smith's idea that it is the knowledge that we have to die that makes us human.\n\nCharles Darwin assumed that human beings share with all forms of life a basic biological predisposition towards survival, in the service of self-preservation, as well as reproduction. But he turned around and said that human beings are uniquely different because we can imagine things that do not yet exist.\n\nDa Vinci and Michelangelo were doodling in their notebooks in the 1500s and people denounced them as crazy. Yet today we routinely transport ourselves by what was originally denounced as the doodlings of a mad man.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard, a Danish existential philosopher, said that we are so smart that we actually come to realize that we exist. If I could see you, I would ask you if you were aware that you were listening to me.\n\nKierkegaard made the point that humans are the only ones who can render themselves the object of their own subjective inquiry, and if you grant him those two theoretical assertions, living things like to stay alive and people are so smart that we know that we are here, we can keep going.\n\nKierkegaard says that it is awe-inspiring to be alive and that some of our finest moments are the result of the spontaneous exuberance that we experience just from the fact that we're here.\n\nThe last sentence of James Joyce's Ulysses is the longest sentence in the history of literature, and it starts and ends with the same word, \"YES\". Kierkegaard says that it is great to be alive, but it is also dreadful, because you will someday die.\n\nKierkegaard pointed out that it's not just the fact that you will someday die that's discombobulating, but the fact that you can die at any moment for reasons that you could never anticipate or control.\n\nThe Elephant Man film is a great film, and the point that Becker makes is that if we only thought about our biological selves, we would never be able to get up in the morning.\n\nBecker says that human beings developed culture to try to minimize the terror of death. Culture consists of beliefs about the nature of reality that we share with our fellow human beings.\n\nIn his book The Birth and Death of Meaning, Becker argues that culture gives us meaning and value by giving us an explanation of the origin of the universe, prescriptions for how we're supposed to behave while we're here, and hope of immortality.\n\nWe may know that we're not gonna be here forever, but we're comforted nonetheless by the prospect that some vestige of our existence will persist over time. We need to believe that life is meaningful, otherwise we may experience depression.\n\nWho among us hasn't dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal, a Nobel Prize, and managing a hedge fund at the same time? Culture helps us feel valuable by providing us with social roles with associated standards of conduct.\n\nHuman beings are so smart that we realize that we exist. We manage this existential terror by embedding ourselves in a culturally constructed belief system that gives us a sense that we're persons of value in a world of meaning.\n\nErnest Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, \"The Denial of Death\", but was roundly denounced in academic circles. Tom, Jeff and I discovered Becker's ideas and started traveling all over North America and Europe to give talks about them.\n\nWe wrote a paper about these ideas, sent it to our flagship journal, The American Psychologist, and six months later we got a rejection. The reviewer said that these ideas were of no interest to any psychologist alive or dead.\n\nI'd like to talk about some areas of inquiry that I think we can't understand without recourse to these ideas, and then I'll also give you a sense of how we've done our studies to determine why I think these ideas are true.\n\nErnest Becker suggests that people can't get along with other human beings because their beliefs about the nature of reality serve to minimize death anxiety. If we accept the validity of an alternative conception of reality, we expose ourselves to the very anxiety our beliefs were built to diminish.\n\nIf you lose faith in your own beliefs about reality and you run into somebody who is different, you're gonna experience anxiety about your own death.\n\nIf I believe that God created the Earth in six days, and I run into somebody in the Borneo of the South Pacific who believes that Earth was gestated out of a giant coconut tree, I will denigrate and belittle them and try to convince them to adopt my beliefs.\n\nIf we believe Ernest Becker, then we cannot understand man's inhumanity to man.\n\nJeff and Tom and I had an accident. We were sitting around one day, bowling, and a thought struck us: if Becker is right, then what would happen if we reminded some people of their own mortality?\n\nWe've done hundreds of experiments to measure how people's culturally constructed beliefs affect their attitude and behavior towards others. We've reminded people of their mortality, shown them gory images of car accidents and autopsies, and interviewed people outside the lab.\n\nWe flash the word death at people while they read stuff on a computer.\n\nIn a study at the University of Arizona, people who were reminded of their mortality rated their fellow Christians higher and their fellow Jewish people lower. They also sat closer to fellow Germans and further away from people who appeared to look like Turkish immigrants.\n\nAfter being reminded of their mortality, Iranians were more supportive of suicide bombing and quite willing to consider becoming a suicide bomber. Americans were also more supportive of the preemptive use of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons against countries who pose no direct threat to us.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said that when the angel of death sounds his trumpet, the pretenses of civilization are blown from men's heads into the mud.\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, said that in times of historical upheaval people often become attracted to a certain kind of leader, a charismatic leader. And after the events of September 11th, 2001, George W. Bush had one of the highest approval ratings.\n\nThe events of September 11th, 2001, may have posed an existential threat to the American public, leading them to elect a president who promised to rid the world of evildoers.\n\nWe did a bunch of experiments in 2003 and 2004 where we reminded people of death and then asked them if they supported President Bush's policies in Iraq. We found that people who were reminded of death were more enthusiastic about President Bush's policies.\n\nAmericans reminded of their mortality were more likely to support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and this is ominous for democracy.\n\nOur concerns about death alienate us from nature and contribute to the degradation of the physical environment. When we are reminded of death, people become uncomfortable with their own bodies and don't like things that would normally be extraordinarily pleasurable, even sexual activity.\n\nA team of Dutch psychologists reminded people of their mortality and found that under controlled conditions they liked forests more than neighborhoods, but when first reminded of their mortality they didn't like forests and now they like the burbs with the symmetrical bushes.\n\nHuman beings in Western society are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the desire for money and stuff. When reminded of their mortality, people say they want to have more money and to have more fancy, luxury items.\n\nPolish researchers found that people drew bigger coins and paper money after being reminded of their mortality, and that people who just got to count money reported having less death and anxiety.\n\nAmerica is currently a Petri dish of psychopathology, with 12% of the population depressed and a third of the population addicted to drugs and alcohol. We need to consider the values that our children are taught to embrace.\n\nThe American dream is highly unlikely to be achieved in the United States. If you embrace the American dream and you're 40 years old in a polyester suit selling three pound burritos on the second shift at the drive through at Taco Bell, well then that's your fault.\n\nI was the last generation of Americans where it was okay to be average, and I fear for the youth today because they are being held accountable for standards that are just not realistically attainable, and this is a recipe for psychological despair.\n\nI'm tempted to stop, but I don't want to leave you with that thought. Let's end on a more propitious note, by recognizing that human beings can use their ingenuity to reduce the destructive potential of their existential fears.\n\nI think it's important to note that death anxiety is not itself the problem. The problem is when we repress death anxiety and it comes back to bear malignant fruit.\n\nErik Erikson said that when parents have the courage to die, their children will have the faith to live, and I think that we can all contribute to making the world a better place.\n\nWe asked municipal court judges in Tucson, Arizona whether or not they thought about death when setting bond for an alleged prostitute. When they were reminded of their mortality, the bond was nine times higher, $455.\n\nLisa's silly joke: next time you get a parking ticket, pray that the judge hasn't driven past a cemetery on the way to sentencing you. There's been more than one study that shows that legal decisions are routinely altered by momentary conditions that include death reminders.\n\nWe should talk afterwards because we think there's other things going on and people aren't so sure when the psychological crap hits the fan.\n\nVera, an atheist, wants to know if religion has anything to do with death denial.\n\nBuddhists are good people, but in Burma, they treat others badly. Atheists are worse than agnostics, because they are convinced of things they can't know, and so they are just as vicious as their theistic counterparts.\n\nWhen atheists are reminded of their mortality, they say they believe in God less, but unconsciously they become more religious just like religious people. So I don't buy the arguments of the Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins of the world.\n\nWe are studying people who work in health care settings, like nurses, surgeons, and first responders, and we don't know yet if death reminders have predictable effects.\n\nWe have not studied people who trend towards suicide, because we can't see a way to do that in an ethical fashion. However, we do have a chapter in our book about suicide that argues that most people who commit suicide believe that there is something better.\n\nMost primitive cultures, including shamanist and animist cultures, are tolerant of other religions, but they still see them as inferior to their own. This is because they see other religions as less than human.\n\nGood question, though, since you're saying that death anxiety is an inherent part of our humanity. Have you looked at children to see if their perspective is different than adults?\n\nWe have a chapter in our book on how children become aware of death. Some research suggests that children as young as nine hate Russian immigrants in Israel and love Jewish people.\n\nBy age 9, the effects that I spoke about tonight are already manifested in kids. But I don't know if the effects happen at the same time for all people, or if there's a developmental trajectory that can shed light on that.\n\nDeath reminders can persist for hours or days in the lab, but we're bombarded with death-related imagery on a relatively regular basis, which raises the question of how much it affects us.\n\nWe are doing research on how attitudes about abortion have been impacted by death anxiety. So far, we have found that Americans reminded of their mortality hate Muslims, object to a mosque being built in their neighborhood, and object to immigrants moving into their neighborhood.\n\nPeople don't seem to care about environmental issues, even after the Inconvenient Truth was released. They have a million excuses about why they aren't going to help the environment, and they don't want to take the blame.\n\nSome people are resistant to the idea of global warming because of death anxiety, but this isn't the only factor. Conservatives are more likely to admit that global warming is real if the problem can be solved through market forces.\n\nI don't know if parents exhibit less fear anxiety than do non-parents, but I do know that when parents are reminded of their mortality, they say they want to have more kids, and they say they want to have them sooner.\n\nPeople who have had near death experiences report lower death anxiety, but when reminded of death, they become the most hateful of people who are different. So we are studying people who have had near death experiences, and measuring unconscious death anxiety.\n\nNear death experiences, we're looking at that now. There are a number of compelling examples of death reminders eliciting bad behavior, culminating in some current events regarding politics.\n\nWe're now trying to figure out if we can leverage some of the same psychological phenomenon to bring out the best in us, rather than just delineate the psychological underpinnings of the most unsavory characteristics of human behavior.\n\nWhen Lisa said that you realized it, when you were five, her epiphany was when her grandmother died. Lisa was eight years old and realized that her mom was gonna grow old and make chocolate pudding for her.\n\nWhen I first read Ernest Becker, I was like wow, this is actually what I've been dwelling on for all of my kid-hood. Jeff and I talk about how our terror-management theory has been our own form of death denial.\n\nShelden's book, The Worm at the Core, The Role of Death in Life, is about how death anxiety makes us more tolerant of others and how it can lead to mental disease.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was five years old, I realized that death was going to happen to me. To this day, I feel shudders of terror when I recall that moment.\n\nErnest Becker argued that humans have a profound fear of death, and that we spend most of our lives trying to explain, forestall, or avoid the inevitability of our own death. Sheldon Solomon has spent 30 years studying this fear.\n\nThroughout human history, theologians, philosophers, and even people sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere have tried to characterize the essence of what it means to be a human being. And one way that people have been characterized is as homo sapiens.\n\nHuman beings are also called homo ludens, homo faber, homo aestheticus, and homo narratization. I think they are all useful heuristic devices that draw our attention to different aspects of our humanity.\n\nWe propose a new designation for humans, homo mortalis, based on Alexander Smith's idea that it is the knowledge that we have to die that makes us human.\n\nCharles Darwin assumed that human beings share with all forms of life a basic biological predisposition towards survival, in the service of self-preservation, as well as reproduction. But he turned around and said that human beings are uniquely different because we can imagine things that do not yet exist.\n\nDa Vinci and Michelangelo were doodling in their notebooks in the 1500s and people denounced them as crazy. Yet today we routinely transport ourselves by what was originally denounced as the doodlings of a mad man.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard, a Danish existential philosopher, said that we are so smart that we actually come to realize that we exist. If I could see you, I would ask you if you were aware that you were listening to me.\n\nKierkegaard made the point that humans are the only ones who can render themselves the object of their own subjective inquiry, and if you grant him those two theoretical assertions, living things like to stay alive and people are so smart that we know that we are here, we can keep going.\n\nKierkegaard says that it is awe-inspiring to be alive and that some of our finest moments are the result of the spontaneous exuberance that we experience just from the fact that we're here.\n\nThe last sentence of James Joyce's Ulysses is the longest sentence in the history of literature, and it starts and ends with the same word, \"YES\". Kierkegaard says that it is great to be alive, but it is also dreadful, because you will someday die.\n\nKierkegaard pointed out that it's not just the fact that you will someday die that's discombobulating, but the fact that you can die at any moment for reasons that you could never anticipate or control.\n\nThe Elephant Man film is a great film, and the point that Becker makes is that if we only thought about our biological selves, we would never be able to get up in the morning.\n\nBecker says that human beings developed culture to try to minimize the terror of death. Culture consists of beliefs about the nature of reality that we share with our fellow human beings.\n\nIn his book The Birth and Death of Meaning, Becker argues that culture gives us meaning and value by giving us an explanation of the origin of the universe, prescriptions for how we're supposed to behave while we're here, and hope of immortality.\n\nWe may know that we're not gonna be here forever, but we're comforted nonetheless by the prospect that some vestige of our existence will persist over time. We need to believe that life is meaningful, otherwise we may experience depression.\n\nWho among us hasn't dreamed of winning an Olympic gold medal, a Nobel Prize, and managing a hedge fund at the same time? Culture helps us feel valuable by providing us with social roles with associated standards of conduct.\n\nHuman beings are so smart that we realize that we exist. We manage this existential terror by embedding ourselves in a culturally constructed belief system that gives us a sense that we're persons of value in a world of meaning.\n\nErnest Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, \"The Denial of Death\", but was roundly denounced in academic circles. Tom, Jeff and I discovered Becker's ideas and started traveling all over North America and Europe to give talks about them.\n\nWe wrote a paper about these ideas, sent it to our flagship journal, The American Psychologist, and six months later we got a rejection. The reviewer said that these ideas were of no interest to any psychologist alive or dead.\n\nJeff, Tom, and I have been doing experimental, social psychology for almost 35 years, and we'd like to address the \"so what\" question and the \"how do we know this is true\" question at the same time.\n\nErnest Becker offers a provocative answer to why people can't get along with other human beings who don't share their beliefs about the nature of reality. He says that if we accept the validity of an alternative conception of reality, we undermine our confidence.\n\nIf you lose faith in your own beliefs about reality and you run into somebody who is different, you're gonna experience anxiety about your own death.\n\nIf I believe that God created the Earth in six days, and I run into somebody in the Borneo of the South Pacific who believes that Earth was gestated out of a giant coconut tree, I will denigrate and belittle them and try to convince them to adopt my beliefs.\n\nErnest Becker argues that we cannot understand human inhumanity to man unless we accept people who are different.\n\nJeff, Tom and I had an accident. We were bowling one day and a thought struck us: if Becker is right, then what would happen if we reminded some people of their own mortality?\n\nWe've done literally hundreds of experiments to measure how people's culturally constructed beliefs affect their attitudes towards others. We've shown people gory images of car accidents and autopsies, and asked people to write down their thoughts and feelings associated with their own death.\n\nWe flash the word death at people while they're reading stuff on a computer.\n\nStudies have shown that reminding people of their mortality affects their attitudes and behaviors. For example, reminding Germans of their mortality makes them sit closer to fellow Germans and further away from people who appear to look like Turkish immigrants.\n\nWe did a study in Iran where we reminded people of their mortality and asked them if they supported suicide bombing. After being reminded of their mortality, Iranians were very supportive of suicide bombing and quite willing to consider becoming one.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said that when the angel of death sounds his trumpet, the pretenses of civilization are blown from men's heads into the mud.\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, said that in times of historical upheaval people often become attracted to a certain kind of leader, a charismatic leader.

We are also uncomfortable with our own bodies and don't like things that would normally be extraordinarily pleasurable, even sexual activity.\n\nA study by Dutch psychologists found that people who were reminded of their mortality liked forests more than neighborhoods, and that when reminded of their mortality in simulated games, they tempered their behavior in the service of maintaining a non renewable natural resource.\n\nHuman beings in Western society are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the desire for money and stuff. When reminded of their mortality, people say they want to have more money and to have more fancy, luxury items.\n\nPolish researchers found that people drew bigger coins and paper money after being reminded of their mortality, and that people who just got to count money reported having less death and anxiety.\n\nAmerica is currently a Petri dish of psychopathology. A third of the population is depressed, another third is addicted to drugs and alcohol, and the final third is watching survivor to see who could drink the most yak urine.\n\nThe American dream is highly unlikely to be achieved in the United States. If you embrace the American dream and you're 40 years old in a polyester suit selling three pound burritos on the second shift at the drive through at Taco Bell, well then that's your fault.\n\nI was the last generation of Americans where it was okay to be average, and I fear for the youth today because they are being held accountable for standards that are just not realistically attainable, and this is a recipe for psychological despair.\n\nI'm tempted to stop, but I don't want to leave you with that thought.

He believed that poetry was a form of expression that was driven by imagination and creativity, whereas science was a form of knowledge that was based on facts and evidence. He argued that poetry and science both had a place in the world and should be seen as two separate entities but should also be seen as being interconnected. He believed that science and poetry could work together to create a better understanding of the world and the human condition. He argued that both were needed to explore the complexities of life and to make sense of the world.\n\n![Frank Zappa Gantz manga panel award winning black and white art by Frank Zappa highly detailed pen and ink matte painting](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0d69cb79-7646-4c76-8437-045435c22349)\n\n\n\n\n![2043 fashion lookbook for Hamcus, 35mm lens, extremely detailed, epic, 3D render, digital art, artstation, 8K artistic photography, photo-realistic](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/08f55855-3235-4aae-b89d-594f32ae5996)\n\n>Just see what takes place without thought.

That knowing will never destroy the mystery: the more you know, the more you know that much remains to be known.\n\t\n\tAnd that is the beauty of life—and the beauty of love. Love is mystery, and the more you know it, the more you are willing to be drowned in it. I am drowned in love. I am drowned in my own love. My love is such that it is ready to suffer, it is ready to cry, it is ready to laugh, it is ready to relish each and every moment of life.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tI am not saying that you should not be cautious. It is not a question of being cautious or not cautious. It is a question of being totally aware in each moment—whatever the moment demands. If the moment demands that I should be cautious, I should be cautious. If the moment demands that I should be daring, I should be daring. But it is my awareness that will decide and not my mind. My mind will not decide; my awareness will decide. And if my awareness decides, then whatsoever my decision, it will be right. If I decide out of mind, then I am bound to be in trouble.\n\t\n\tThis is what has happened to the world. People have decided out of the mind and they have created a world that is in deep trouble. The individual cannot be at ease; the society cannot be at ease; the whole world cannot be at ease. Everybody is in deep anxiety, in deep trouble. And this is so because you have decided out of the mind. You have decided to be cautious, and caution has become your philosophy.\n\t\n\tIt is not a matter of caution and no caution; it is a matter of being aware and not being aware. When you are very much aware, then you will move with the moment. Then you will not be in any problem.\n\t\n\tLife is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived and loved. Solving problems is for idiots, for those who don’t have any intelligence.\n\t\n\t“I am not a problem”\n\t\n\t“I don’t have to solve myself”\n\t\n\t“I have to allow myself to be free of problems.”\n\t\n\tBy allowing yourself to be free of problems, you have become intelligent. By allowing yourself to be free of problems, you have become aware. By becoming aware, you have become intelligent.\n\t\n\tSo what is the difference? The difference is very simple: in awareness, you do not know anything; in intelligence, you do not know anything. But in intelligence, you are enough. In awareness, you are not enough; you are too much. Something is missing in you.\n\t\n\tSo if you are intelligent, what is missing in you?\n\t\n\tYou are whole, you are complete.\n\t\n\tIf you are aware, you are complete, but something is missing.\n\t\n\tWhat is that?\n\nThe Witness.\n\nThis is where I find the Witness to be very important, because the Witness is what you are.\n\nWhen you are aware of something, you are complete, but when you are aware of the awareness, you are with the Witness.\n\nThis is why we say in Non-Duality, you are the Witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the awareness, you are complete, you are the Witness, you are God, you are the Absolute, you are the One, you are the Tao, you are the Self, you are the I AM, you are the Absolute.\n\nYou are not the observer, who is watching the mind. That is not you.\n\nThe observer is also a false identity, it is an object in the mind.\n\nIt is easy to mistake the observer for the Witness.\n\nBut the Witness is the awareness of the observer.\n\nThe observer is not the Witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the observer, you are the Witness.\n\nThe witness is not aware of the observer.\n\nThe observer is aware of the witness.\n\nWhen you are aware of the witness, you are the observer.\n\nBut when you are aware of both the witness and the observer, you are neither.\n\nThe observer is a thought in the mind, the witness is being itself.\n\nThe observer and the witness are two distinct aspects of the same thing.\n\nThe observer is the seer and the witness is the seen.\n\nYet it is the same seer who sees himself when he witnesses.\n\nThus you are the observer, the witness and the seen.\n\nYou are the seer, the seen and the sight.\n\nYou are the perceiver, the perceived and the perception.\n\nYou are the knower, the known and the knowledge.\n\nThis is the secret of the triad.\n\n"

His most famous works are his Parallel Lives, a series of biographies of famous Greeks and Romans, and his Moralia, a collection of essays and writings on a variety of topics. Plutarch's works were influential in the development of moral philosophy and the revival of Stoic and Neoplatonic thought in the Renaissance. He is also seen as a major influence on the development of the Western philosophical tradition, particularly through his writings on justice and other virtues. Plutarch's themes revolve around the idea of virtue, both in the sense of moral excellence and of practical wisdom in understanding how to live a good life. He emphasizes the importance of making choices that lead to a life of virtue, and he exhorts readers to strive towards excellence in all aspects of their lives.\n\n\n![a lifelike linocut engraving of a singular president lula. red, black and white color scheme ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/198dfa2c-73ce-43f4-824d-be7df01af1db)\n\n"

An attempt to classify [[Bergson]]'s **philosophy** in either of these ways is hardly likely to be successful, since it cuts across all the recognized divisions.\n>\n>But there is another way of classifying **philosophies**, less precise, but perhaps more helpful to the non-**philosophical**; in this way, the principle of division is according to the predominant desire which has led the [[Philosopher]] to **philosophize**. Thus we shall have **philosophies** of feeling. inspired by the love of [[Happiness]]; theoretical **philosophies**, inspired by the love of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]; and practical **philosophies**, inspired by the love of action. \n>~ [[Russell]]\n\nPhilosophy is a sort of battle between the known and the unknown, between the adult and the child, the old and the new, the rational and the emotional, the revealer and the concealed, the conscious and the unconscious.\n\n# Love of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Skepticism]]\n\n### [[Empiricism]]\n\n### [[Rationalism]]\n\n## Unclassified\n\n### [[Idealism]]\n\n### [[Scholasticism]]\n\n# Love of [[Emotion]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Orphism]]\n\n### [[Bacchism]]\n\n### [[Epicureanism]]\n\n### [[Buddhism]]\n\n### [[Nihilism]]\n\n### [[Philosophy/Romanticism/Romanticism|Romantocism]]\n\n# Love of action \n#todo define action\n\n>Be a philosopher, but amidst your **philosophy**, be a man ~ [[Hume]]\n\n## Methods\n\n### [[Stoicism]]\n\n### [[Confusianism]]\n\n### [[Taoism]]\n\n### [[Liberalism]]\n\n# Philosophy is the ultimate purpose of life\n\n\n>Without mus..**philosophy**, life would be a mistake ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>Of all people only those are at leisure who make time for **philosophy**, only those are really alive. For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs. All the years that have passed before them are added to their own. ~ [[Seneca]]\n\nUltimately, our inquiry of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is unlimited, we will likely never reach maximal [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], it is impossible, the universe will die before, [[Big crunch]].\nShould we jump off from this infinite treadmill that is the quest of the acquisition of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]? Or is it the purpose of life?\nIf then, the search for [[Compound Knowledge]] is the most fulfilling one, that is **philosophy**, [[Mathematic]], [[Physic]], [[Biology]].\n\n>To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that **philosophy**, in our age, can still do for those who study it. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n>My purpose is to exhibit **philosophy** as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n>**Philosophy** is not one of the natural [[Science|sciences]]. (The word '**philosophy**' must mean something which stands above or below, but not beside the natural [[Science|sciences]].) The object of **philosophy** is the logical clarification of thoughts. **Philosophy** is not a theory but an activity. A **philosophical** work consists essentially of elucidations. The result of **philosophy** is not a number of '**philosophical** propositions,' but to make propositions clear. **Philosophy** should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred ~ [[Wittgenstein]]\n\n**Philosophy** is [[Mathematic]] for words.\n\n>What a lot of trouble one avoids if one refuses to have anything to do with the common herd! To have no job, to devote one's time to literature, is the most wonderful thing in the world. ~ [[Cicero]]"

You must be willing to be passionate about the world around you, to feel deeply for your neighbor, and to be open to the joys and sorrows of life.

He maintained that material objects only exist through being perceived. To the objection that, in that case, a tree, for instance, would cease to exist if no one was looking at it, he replied that God always perceives everything; if there were no God, what we take to be material objects would have a jerky life, suddenly leaping into being when we look at them; but as it is, owing to God's perceptions, trees and rocks and stones have an existence as continuous as common sense supposes. This is, in his opinion, a weighty argument for the existence of God.\n\nActually, this way of thinking is used in computer graphics as an optimization technique called \"frustum culling\", objects, for an agent, only exists when perceived\n\n![[Pasted image 20210628084400.png]]\n\nCan we really deny the existence of what we don't perceive? I don't see infrared color but it exists?\n\n**Idealism** tend to derive into [[Nihilism]], [[Nietzsche]] said:\n>All the idealism of mankind, hitherto, is on the point of turning into Nihilism—may be shown to be a belief in absolute worthlessness, i.e. purposelessness\n\n[[Space]] and [[Physic/Time|time]] are an illusion?\n\n>I come now to a singular feature of Hegel's philosophy, which distinguishes it from the philosophy of Plato or Plotinus or Spinoza. Although ultimate reality is timeless, and time is merely an illusion generated by our inability to see the whole, yet the time-process has an intimate relation to the purely logical process of the dialectic. World history, in fact, has advanced through the categories, from Pure Being in China (of which Hegel knew nothing except that it was) to the Absolute Idea, which seems to have been nearly, if not quite, realized in the Prussian State. I cannot see any justification, on the basis of his own metaphysic, for the view that world history repeats the transitions of the dialectic, yet that is the thesis which he developed in his Philosophy of History. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n> La pathologie de l'idée est dans l'**idéalisme**, où l'idée occulte la réalité qu'elle a mission de traduire et se prend pour seule ~ [[Edgar Morin]]\n\n# Idealism is required to achieve [[Artificial general intelligence|AGI]]?\n\n**Idealism** helps us realize the limits of our [[Philosophy/Rationality/Intelligence|intelligence]]?

Now, ChatGPT seems to offer better answers than Google Search because it may have a better understanding of our problem (short context).\n\nExample:\n\nI want to understand \"[[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]\", I search Google for it, read Wikipedia, but Wikipedia is formatted to be understood by the vast majority.\nOn the other hand, if I ask ChatGPT (which can take longer sentences/contexts), I can ask subsequent questions allowing the AI to understand where I don't understand the topic.\nI could have gotten the same result by asking a physicist, of course, but it's pretty hard to find one, and also an AI doesn't care about its time, or I have to pay for the service, while a human's time is more expensive\n\nSo should I sell my Google stocks?"

I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your horse.**\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n>To put it another way: if **wealth** is giving you fewer options instead of more (and more varied) options, you’re doing it wrong. ~[[Nassim Taleb]]\n\n>A Man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep his Nose all his Life to the Grindstone, and die not worth a Groat at last. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\nBut most people increase their spending proportionally to their income?\n\n>Rather go to bed supperless, than in debt. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\nLive below your means.\n\n>If you wish to have leisure for your [[Mind|mind]], either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. ~ [[Seneca]]\n\nYou do not need to run the treadmill of money-making if you live as a poor man even though you have decent amount of money.\n\n>Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. ~ [[George Clason]]\n\n\n\n>But **wealth** had another advantage, too. Not only could it buy wives directly, it could also buy \"power.\" It is noteworthy that it is hard to distinguish between wealth and power before the time of the Renaissance. Until then there was no such thing as an power economic sector independent of the power structure. A man's livelihood and his allegiance were owed to the same social superior. Power is, roughly speaking, the ability to call do your bidding, and that depended strictly on wealth (with a little help from violence).\n>~ [[Biology/Matt Ridley|Ridley]]\n\n\n\n\n## Do not go into [[Entrepreneurship]] for **wealth**\n\n[[Entrepreneurship]] is not the best way to get wealth, or at least you will need a lot of patience. If you can wait a dozen of years, yes.\n\nBecause wealth is about being able to do nothing for months while still earning [[Money]].\n\nThere is many other reasons to go into [[Entrepreneurship]] though.\n\n\n## [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] beget **wealth**\n\n>The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner\n>~ [[Naval Ravikant]]\n\n## Why wealth is seen as \"bad\"\n\n>But since for most of the world’s history the main route to wealth was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Wealth is not a [[Zero Sum Game]]\n\n>Babylon became the wealthiest city of the ancient world because its citizens were the richest people of their time. They appreciated the value of money. They practiced sound financial principles in acquiring money, keeping money and making their money earn more money. They provided for themselves what we all desire . incomes for the future.\n>~ [[George Clason]]\n\nEveryone can be rich \n\n>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It’s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Origin\n\n>In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him.\n> ~ [[Adam Smith]]\n\n>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can’t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n### Comparative advantage\n\n![[Comparative Advantage]]\n\n## Wealth used to be evil\n\n>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Scientists and open sourcers are heroes donating wealth to society\n\n>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we’re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I’m running on the computer I’m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.\n>~ [[Paul Graham]]\n\n\n\n## Links\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxGn2MBVdJI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

What I am more concerned about is the impact of AI on information exposure on humans (how, when, what, quantity).\n\n\n-   Programmers are going to **code more and more in natural language, human language, in higher-level language**, I bet you can already create a website now by saying “hey AI I want an e-commerce website with this design X…”\n-   We need to teach and work with AI, maybe we will have sort of **AI teachers**, keeping the model aligned with our goals.\n-   **Prompt engineers** (it’s already there), that is, when using GPT3 the input you give it influences a lot of the performance, say I want to create a function that talk about “black cats”, giving the model “this is a story about black cats:” will work better than “this is a story about cats:”"

The other part is that neither farmers nor hunter-gatherers are naked, at least not figuratively. Farmers tend to breathe out nastier germs, to own better weapons and armor, to own more-powerful technology in general, and to live under centralized governments with literate elites better able to wage wars of conquest. Hence the next four chapters will explore how the ultimate cause of food production led to the proximate causes of germs, literacy, technology, and centralized government.\n>~ [[Jared Diamond]]\n\nIf we have [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization|decentralized companies]], why not decentralized state altogether?\n\nCorporations, like [[Politic|the state]], are another kind of [[Philosophy/Humans/Story|story]] we like to make, and by story I mean what **Harari** so often argues about.\n\n> morality before the church, trade before the state, exchange before money, social contracts before Hobbes, welfare before human rights, culture before Babylon, society before Greece, self-interest before Adam Smith, greed before capitalism  \n> ~ [[Matt Ridley]]\n\nThe state has its origins in the emergence of trade, which required some laws to be enforced to ensure proper game-theoretic interactions. My idea of what we need to become a decentralized state is to automate the law using [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]], because the law is just a collection of heuristics, and to make the processes secure using [[Blockchain]].\n\nI don’t want to be French or American or whatever, just human.\n\n> When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.  \n> ~ [[Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\n\nBut perhaps the idea of a decentralized state makes more sense when we are in space, as it will be much harder to hold the leash of centralization.\n\n## History is flattening cooperation\n\nWe went from very hierarchical society of the style of the Inca having 15000 women just for him, to kings, to decentralized, flat, society.\n\n## Where is decentralized police?\n\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/posts/etuk3rsSz3iiXgcp7/louis-beaumont-s-shortform?commentId=9xQbgAzwCM37Ydzon#9xQbgAzwCM37Ydzon\n\nActually we don’t need it or do we?"

This fallacy is based on the idea that because the initial investment has already been made, it would be a waste to not continue investing in the same thing. It can lead people to ignore the actual value of the investment and make decisions based on the already invested amount instead of the potential returns. This can lead to irrational decisions and missed opportunities, as people are unwilling to cut their losses and move on.\n\n![submerged vessel by gediminas pranckevicius ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/002f40c2-2c4f-4d4b-a5ae-3850bace63d7)\n\n\n"

He argued that suffering is not a punishment or a sign of evil, but rather a necessary part of life which can be used as an opportunity for self-reflection and growth. He believed that suffering can be beneficial if it is seen as an opportunity to learn and to evolve as a person. He argued that the key to overcoming suffering is to become fully aware of it and to accept it, rather than trying to escape it. His teachings have inspired many people to find peace and understanding in difficult times.\n\n"

Should be pretty quick to implement\n\n#### 18-07-2021\n\nWould I use **Langame** in its current state? No.\nI mean I already use it with some of my friends, every day, it's been great, but social features are too weak now.\nI doubt humans can live without social interactions, it is imprinted in our [[Genome]]. I am thinking about social features, such as [[Groupism]], maybe scheduled **Langames**. I want to avoid large groups though, as I strongly believe [[Conversation]]s do not scale.\n\nI like the idea of beta.spiel.com \"achieve [[Fractal]] locality for communities\".\n\nI really want to play with the [[Brain]]-extending features, but I really need to work on social side.\n\n#### 24-07-2021\n\nI am extremely busy, but hopefully a browser extension for **Langame** is coming soon.\n\n![[Drawing 2021-07-24 09.38.49.svg]]\n\nAh, and also **Langame** has been approved for OpenAI production 🎉.\n\n#### 26-07-2021\n\nearly browser extension\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-07-26 at 16.13.12.png]]\n\n#### 01-08-2021\n\nbrowser extension\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.29.07.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.54.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.46.png]]\n\n![[Screenshot 2021-08-01 at 14.28.26.png]]\n\n#### 17-08-2021\n\nActually, I love **Langame**, but I must transmit this love to others :), **RECRUIT YOUR FUCKING USERS** a la [[Paul Graham]].\n\nOn another thought, I thought about a business model, because getting money would help grow the project:\n- People can buy more tokens (to get **Langames**, i.e. conversation starters & more), it would be clearly disclaimed that when they buy tokens, it uses all the money to instantly generate some new **Langames**\n- It would be possible to have a subscription also to make things automatic, and ofc would use all the money to generate more **Langames**\n\n\nAnother thought, I am considering the possibility of open sourcing Langame, as the goal of this project is for humans, not for making money, maybe open source could grow the project better than private + more money/business? Really early idea though, not sure doable yet.\n\n>Without trade, innovation just does not happen. Exchange is to technology as sex is to evolution.

The voice is turned to text. Later they can revisit their conversations, export it to obsidian.md, roamresearch.com or plain text**... I'd avoid recording other people imho?\n- **Let people generate starters and edit content / topics. Then all are checked manually and confirmed/edited or not**. Later will build a filtering model, when enough data and time, I've done this for another project, fine-tuning OpenAI for this kind of classification. I pretty much **like lesswrong.com collaborative system of tagging, upvoting etc**. It gives me some thoughts, thought I'm still very concerned about how to scale generation without lowering quality.

I am transparent with my co-founders, I strongly believe I can do both, I'm quite good at time management, focusing and [[Deep work]]\n\n# Ideas\n- let people throw an idea, a quote (readwise.io), something into a box, it create a convenient starter based on it -> **MORE COLLABORATIVE FEATURES**\n- adjust starters/topics/app to **people personality**\n- exporting audio also? (instead of speech to text)\n- connect plenty of apps (**twitter share Memes, Readwise, Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Youtube?**) tighter than the native share thing which adds friction\n- With the slow transition from big physical computers, human-machine interfaces, to [[Brain Computer Interfaces]], currently, earbuds (Apple launched it as always), we could give **conversation feedbacks into people ear** as audio (\"you should be nicer\", \"try to ask this, that...\")\n\n-->\n\n%%"

It is actively choosing to be kind and understanding when it is more difficult to do so. It is about being selfless and doing what you can to make someone else’s life easier or better without expecting anything in return. Radical kindness is about being kind to strangers, even when it might be uncomfortable, or going out of your way to help someone you know. It is about treating everyone with respect, regardless of their age, race, gender, or social status. It is about recognizing that we are all connected and that the kind deeds we do for others will come back around to bless us in some way. Radical kindness is a powerful force that can transform lives and create a more compassionate world.\n\n\n![pastel painting of colorful birds ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/01809f56-49ab-40f3-b3ce-d1c699368549)\n\n![a painting about the wish of being loved for real once after all the sad relationships had. painting. ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/010bcbc0-4192-48a6-a249-370d97b4694b)\n\n%%Radical kindness, love, altruistic, hugging, painting by Van Gogh, 8K%%\n\n\n\n\n\n![[1672135465630_Radical_kindness__love__painting_by_Van_Gogh__8K_.jpg]]\n\n\n\n![ethereal and expressive abstract oil painting of a person surrounded by ribbons with random letters on them](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/03e6162c-94ba-4a83-be22-42640a7f2816)\n\n\n![art by diego velazquez, artstation, an oil paiting of a sparrow, oleo, highly detailed, sharp focus ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/02fe3e08-36a6-4e2c-a799-3487d682da02)\n\n"

In microeconomics, they try to characterize it this way: The principal’s incentives are different than the agent’s incentives, so the owner of the business wants what is best for the business and will make the most money. The agent generally wants whatever will look good to the principal, or might make them the most friends in the neighborhood or in the business, or might make them personally the most money. \n>\n>You see this a lot with hired-gun CEOs running public companies, where the ownership of the public company is distributed so widely that there’s no principal remaining. Nobody owns more than 1% of the company. The CEO takes charge, stuffs the board with their buddies and then starts issuing themselves low-priced stock options, or doing a lot of stock buybacks because their compensation is based directly tied to the stock price.\n>~ [[Naval Ravikant]]\n\n[[Marx]] stressed that the employer purchases the worker's time on the labour market, not the worker's work. In companies the employees are not paid by the value they bring which creates a misalignment between employee and employer.\n\n>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful.

Even if the dis puted claims of older human occupation sites in the Americas prove valid, those postulated pre-Clovis inhabitants remained for unknown reasons very sparsely distributed and did not launch a Pleistocene proliferation of hunter-gatherer societies with expanding populations, technology, and art as in the Old World.

This type of market relies on the laws of supply and demand, allowing prices to be determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers. In a free market, businesses have the freedom to produce whatever goods and services they choose, and buyers have the freedom to purchase whatever goods and services they want. This system allows for a more efficient allocation of resources and encourages competition, which can lead to lower prices, higher quality goods and services, and increased innovation.\n\n\n>The message from history is so blatantly obvious – that free trade causes mutual prosperity while protectionism causes poverty – that it seems incredible that anybody ever thinks otherwise.\n>~ [[Biology/Matt Ridley|Ridley]]\n\nI.e.

This strategy involves cooperating with the other person at first, and then mirroring their moves. This type of approach is likely to result in a win-win outcome, as both parties will recognize that they can benefit from cooperating. By using a positive and playful voice, you are showing your willingness to work together and engender trust. This trust is a crucial part of successful negotiations and can lead to solutions that both parties are happy with.\n\n\n## The Bully\n\n>The Bully (aka UAW Negotiator)  \n>The bully negotiates by yelling and screaming, forcing issues, and threatening the other party. Most folks who are bullies aren't the smart and don't really understand the issues; rather, they try to win by force. There are two ways to deal with bullies: punch them in the nose or mellow out so much that you sap their strength. If you can outbully the bully, go for it. But if you are wrong, then you've ignited a volcano. Unlike on the children's playground, getting hit by a bully during a negotiation generally doesn't hurt; so unless this is your natural ne gotiating style, our advice is to chill out as your adversary gets hotter.\n\n## The Technocrat\n\n>The Technocrat (aka Pocket Protector Person)  \n>This is the technical nerd. Although they won't yell at you like the bully and you don't wonder if there is a real human being behind the facade like you do with the nice guy, you will feel like you are in endless detail hell. The technocrat has a billion issues and has a hard time deciding what's really important, since to them everything is important for some reason. Our advice is to grin and bear it and perhaps play Fortnite while you are listening to the other side drag on. Technocrats tend to cause you to lose your focus during the ne- gotiation. Make sure you don't by remembering what you care about and conceding the other points. But make sure you cover all the points together, as the technocrat will often negotiate every point from scratch, not taking into consideration the give-and-take of each side during the negotiation. Sometimes this role is simply that: a role. Many folks have endless energy for this stuff and will use this tactic to simply tire you out during the negotiation.\n\n## The Nice Gay\n\n>The Nice Gay (aka Used-Car Salesman)  \n>Whenever you interact with this pleasant person, you feel like they are trying to sell you something. Often, you aren't sure that you want what they are selling. When you say no, the nice guy will either be openly disappointed or will keep on smiling at you just like the audi ence at a Tony Robbins event. In their world, life is great as long as you acquiesce to their terms (or buy this clean 2010 Chrysler Sebring). As the negotiation unfolds, the nice guy is increasingly hard to pin down on anything. While the car salesman always needs to go to their manager, the nice-guy negotiator regularly responds with talk \"Let me consider that and get back to you.\" While the nice guy doesn't yell at you like the bully, it's often frustrating that you can\n\n## The Wimp\n\n>The Wimp (aka George McFly)  \n>The wimp may sound like the perfect dance partner here, but they have their own issues. Our bet is that you can take their wallet pretty easily during the negotiation, but if you get too good a deal it will come back to haunt you. And then you get to live with them on your board of directors once you close your financing. With the wimp, you end up negotiating both sides of the deal. Sometimes this is harder than having a real adversary.\n\n## Smooth, Steady, and Smart\n\n>Smooth, Steady, and Smart (aka Diane Lockhart from The Good Fight)  \n>The last of the personalities is the person who really has it all. This per son can shape-shift into one or more of the personas we mentioned but has a natural calm brilliance that makes for a strong adversary. This person spends the right amount of time preparing, knows all the points at play, and has done their homework on you. They are so confident of their work product that they ooze a legitimate calm like they are walking in a park. If you've done your homework, the two of you probably will engender immediate respect and sometimes even trust. This is the best of all worlds and truly leads to a win-win out- come. On the other hand, if you haven't done your homework, they will steamroll you while making you feel good about it. Later on, that evening, you will feel differently as you commiserate with yourself over your favorite adult beverage.\n\n>You should never make an offer first. There's no reason to, unless you have another concrete one on the table. Why run the risk of aiming too low?\n\n\n>~ [[Brad Feld - Venture Deals Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist]]"

You fall in love.  \n  >\n>Then after a few days you start going deeper into the woman. You start loving her heart. Now a far more beautiful revelation is coming to you. The body becomes secondary; the heart becomes primary. A new vision has arisen, a new peak. If you go on loving the woman, sooner or later you will find there are peaks beyond peaks, depths beyond depths. Then you start loving the soul of the woman. Then it is not only her heart - now that has become secondary. Now it is the very person, the very presence, the very radiance, the aliveness, that unknown phenomenon of her being - that she is. The body is very far away, the heart has also gone away - now the being is.  \n  >\n>And then one day this particular woman's being becomes far away. Now you start loving womanhood in her, the femininity, the feminineness, that receptivity. Now she is not a particular woman at all, she simply reflects womanhood, a particular form of womanhood. Now it is no longer individual, it is becoming more and more universal. And one day that womanhood has also disappeared - you love the humanity in her. Now she is not just a representative of woman, she is also a representative of man as much. The sky is becoming bigger and bigger. Then one day it is not humanity, but existence. That she exists, that's all that you want - that she exists. You are coming very close to God.  \n  >\n>Then the last point comes - all formulations and all forms disappear and there is God. You have found God through your woman, through your man. Each love is an echo of God's love\n>~ [[Osho]]\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-18 08.27.06 - Incommensurable love falling from the sky on a couple in the grass under the sparkling sun, oil on canvas.png]]\nhttps://youtu.be/AVjRuM7Rong\nhttps://youtu.be/JxPj3GAYYZ0\n\n\n>One can promise actions, but not feelings, for the latter are involuntary. He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power. He can, however, promise those actions that are usually the consequence of love, hatred, or faithfulness, but that can also spring from other motives: for there are several paths and motives to an action. A promise to love someone forever, then, means, ‘As long as I love you I will render unto you the actions of love; if I no longer love you, you will continue to receive the same actions from me, if for other motives.’ Thus the illusion remains in the minds of one’s fellow men that the love is unchanged and still the same.\n>One is promising that the semblance of love will endure, then, when without self-deception one vows everlasting love.\n>~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.\n>~ [[A History Of Western Philosophy - Russell, Bertrand|Russell -  Bertrand]]\n## Scholar answer\n\n### Psychology\n\n>~ [[Ernest Becker]]\n\n>Rank could conclude that the love relationship of modern man is a religious problem.\n\n>We turn to the love partner for the experience of the heroic, for perfect validation; we expect them to “make us good” through love.\n\n>When we say that sex and death are twins, we understand it on at least two levels. The first level is philosophical-biological. Animals who procreate, die. Their relatively short life span is somehow connected with their procreation. Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to procreate.\n\n>Is one oppressed by the burden of his life? Then he can lay it at his divine partner’s feet. Is self-consciousness too painful, the sense of being a separate individual, trying to make some kind of meaning out of who one is, what life is, and the like? Then one can wipe it away in the emotional yielding to the partner, forget oneself in the delirium of sex, and still be marvellously quickened in the experience.\n\n>It seems to be difficult for the individual to realize that there exists a division between one’s spiritual and purely human needs, and that the satisfaction or fulfillment for each has to be found in different spheres. As a rule, we find the two aspects hopelessly confused in modern relationships, where one person is made the godlike judge over good and bad in the other person. In the long run, such symbiotic relationship becomes demoralizing to both parties, for it is just as unbearable to be God as it is to remain an utter slave.\n\n## rnd\n\n>Romantics value intensity over stability. Realists value security over passion. But both are often disappointed, for few people can live happily at either extreme.\n>~ [[Esther Perel - Mating in Captivity - Reconciling the Erotic and the Domestic]]\n\n\n### Evolutionary psychology\n\n![[Biology/Sex]]\n\n\n### Disney and its Portrayal of Love[^1]\n\n\tThe first era of princesses adhere to the idea of love at first sight. All of the\n\tprincesses end up with a dashing prince, whom they barley know and have only met once\n\tor twice. No information is given on how their romantic relationships are formed and/or\n\tmaintained. All of them fall in love, get married, and somehow live happily ever after\n\t(Tanner, Haddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). This also sends the message that when\n\ta man and woman meet, they instantaneously fall in love. No time is needed to elapse\n\tand no other common factors need to be in place in order for love to form (Tanner,\n\tHaddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). These three princesses fear ending up alone and\n\teven fantasize about the day they’ll meet their prince. They all sing about the possibility\n\tof falling in love and finding immediate happiness. Their entire narrative as a character\n\tis to find a happy ending through romance (Whelan, 2012).\n\t\n\tAll three of the princesses are also saved by their male counterparts. Snow White\n\tand Aurora are both placed in a deathly coma. Their very lives depend on their prince\n\tfinding and rescuing them with true love’s kiss. Cinderella’s life didn’t depend on her\n\tfalling in love, but her livelihood was dependent on being saved by the prince from \u0000\n\t16\n\tenslavement (Junn, 1997; Whelan, 2012). The first era of princesses also engaged in\n\tmore love-related behaviors than their male counterparts, such as making their desire for\n\tromance known. References to marriage and weddings were also highly common\n\tthroughout the three movies (Junn, 1997).\n\t\n\tThe emphasis for the second era of princesses is placed on ending up with a suitor\n\twhom the princess loves. They want to choose the right partner and still be able to fulfill\n\ttheir dreams (Whelan, 2012). The films from the second era actually refer to love 2.5\n\ttimes more than the first era. Jasmine, for example, rebels against her arranged marriage\n\tand focuses on pursuing Aladdin because she falls in love with him (Junn, 1997). The\n\tideas of marriage and weddings decreased as compared to the first era, which shows\n\timprovement because marriage is not their only end game. Mulan, for example, does not\n\tmarry her love interest and instead decides to pursue a dating relationship (Tanner,\n\tHaddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003). Pocahontas breaks this stereotype even more\n\tbecause her romantic relationship completely dissolves. She instead chooses the love of\n\ther family and stays behind with them (Aidman, 1999). Love also gets represented as\n\tsomething that forms over time, especially in Mulan and Beauty and the Beast which\n\tshows progress in how love is portrayed (Tanner, Haddock, Zimmerman, & Lund, 2003).\n\tAlthough the second era of princesses do break some of the traditional stereotypes\n\tconcerning romance, their ultimate goal still remains to find a suitable partner for\n\tmarriage (Do Rozario, 2004). This is present in Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The\n\tLittle Mermaid. Mulan does not marry her suitor in the end, but she does give up her\n\ttomboyish identity to enter a relationship with Shang. The film also alludes to the fact\n\tthat they will enter a romantic relationship that will most likely lead to marriage. Love \u0000\n\t17\n\tand marriage serve as a way to tame and domesticate these rebellious women by having\n\tthem settle down (Whelan, 2012). Their happily ever after still seems to be dependent on\n\tfinding a man (Junn, 1997). Pocahontas, as briefly mentioned earlier, does not adhere to\n\tthis stereotype. However, the interpretation of her story is completely distorted and\n\thistorically inaccurate. Pocahontas never had a romantic relationship with John Smith\n\tand eventually does leave her family to marry and move to England. Therefore, one\n\tcould argue that the historical facts reflect stereotypical portrayals of love (Superhuman4,\n\t2015).\n\t\n\tWomen’s attractiveness to men is also more apparent in this era when it comes to\n\tfinding a suitable mate. Compared to the first era, these films show 7.5 times more\n\tsexually related depictions of women. The princesses engaged in more sexually\n\tprovocative stances to try and attract a partner, such as striking certain poses and\n\tprimping themselves before seeing their prince (Junn, 1997). These princesses are\n\tdepicted as highly attractive and more voluptuous with bigger busts (Junn, 1997).\n\tIn the first and second era, the princesses are shown as having to abandon their\n\town desires in order to pursue marriage (Lee, 2008). They often have to overcome\n\tparental demands or leave their families and homes in order to marry and get their\n\thappily ever after. The princes, however, did not have external factors preventing them\n\tfrom marrying the woman of their choosing. They could choose their partners as they\n\tpleased and their happiness was not dependent on finding love, but simply a benefit (Lee,\n\t2008). This shows how romance and the princesses happily ever afters are still\n\tdependent on finding a romantic suitor, even if they choose not to pursue marriage\n\t(Whelan, 2012). \n\n---\n\n\tThe Disney princess films important cultural artifacts when one considers the gender stereotypes, particularly roles of women, over the course of the last seventy years. I argue that the princesses in each of these films are positive role models of women who have slowly yet effectively challenged the gender restrictions of the past while advocating for equality and ultimate success for women. Snow White resembles the flapper and hardworking attitude necessary in the 1930s, Cinderella maintains a positive attitude for self-preservation, Pocahontas pushes societal expectations to advocate for herself, Merida refuses to conform to traditional expectations, and Anna and Elsa are strong confident women who are not afraid of success. Looking at the relationships between the princesses and the animals is important as these creatures serve as a crucial piece of evidence to the positive messages that viewers may deduce from the pieces. The animals highlight the strength, determination, spunk, and perseverance of the women in these pieces by advocating for their respective protagonist. Society has evolved to the point that these figures are no longer necessary and I predict that strong figures will continue to appear in Disney productions. This research is important to consider when one considers the Disney princesses as positive role models for women. As I have Page | 34 evaluated, there is much evidence to indicate they are progressive images of women should be appreciated by modern audiences.[^2]\n\n\n[^1]: https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=edspec201019\n[^2]: https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=uhp_theses"

Physical touch is any act of physical affection, such as holding hands or giving a hug. Quality time is dedicated time spent together, such as going on a date or taking a walk. Receiving gifts is any tangible item that shows appreciation, such as a bouquet of flowers or a box of chocolates.

And of course before he went into the deep freeze he left all his securities and his worldly belongings at his broker's with instructions to do the best he could for him. And twenty years later, after the deep freeze had worked, he was unthawed and came out of the deep freeze, and of Course the first thing he did was to run to the telephone to call his broker. And his broker said to him, \"Well you know, you're a millionaire many times over.\" \"Oh, really?\" said the man. \"What happened to this stock?\" And the broker said it went from here to here; you know... It multiplied ten times... twenty times. \"What happened to this stock?\" He kept on going. But suddenly, the telephone operator interrupted, the man was just ecstatic the telephone operator interrupted and said, \"Sorry, your three minutes are up. That'll be $250,000 for the next Three minutes, please.\" (Laughter) That's real inflation. That's at the moment a story, but it's not a story which does not have some examples in history.

Can’t the human brain adapt to new social structures?  \nShould we build software that respects a fractal model, i.e., that keeps the size of local groups below a certain number?  \nIn my experience, conversations don’t scale, i.e. the best conversations have less than 4 members.  \nDoesn’t this make sense, as each individual has different goals, model of the world, and personalities, so that personalities multiply rather than add up, it doesn’t scale?\n\nWhere do you see fractal patterns in communities, in politics, in social networks?  \nDoes the disrespect of this pattern harm social interactions?\n\n```\nHi @louis1, this is an interesting topic, thank you for bringing it in!\n\nTo me, Dunbar’s number is not a figure, it is a concept: there is a limit to our social networks, to how many nodes our attention can process in parallel. 150 may indicate the magnitude of this limit, although there is no reason to consider this number in particular. If we consider a population and the Dunbar’s limit for each individual, we’ll obviously look at a distribution. Skills or conditions may affect this limit (e.g. sales representatives or physicians may have greater limits, or some form of autism may reduce it).\n\nNow, the fractal aspect is interesting. Considering your example about number of participants beyond which a conversation’s quality would suffer. Could we transpose this at higher scale?  \nDoes it apply to the number of teams that can collaborate together at once within an organization? To the number of organizations that can collaborate together within a society? To the number of societies on a planet? To the number of planets in a solar system, or beyond and up to universes?  \nI do not have answers, although I am interested to read thoughts from the Farnam Street Learning Community!\n```\n\n# 240922\n\nThat’s an interesting connection to “company culture”, I also see it as shared knowledge across different scales\n\n![[Pasted image 20220812142330.png]]\n\n\nWhen a problem occurs in a group, you want every member to pick similar solutions in the solution space.\n\nI don’t have a lot of experience in maintaining culture in a group, but in my company we try to put actions in place for that, because actions seem to be a better way to maintain culture than words.  \nFor example, we believe in transparency/honesty, so every month we have to give 5 praises and one critique to each other one-to-one.\n\nI’m not sure how different scales differ, maybe there is a more or less linearity though?\n\n![[Pasted image 20220924093215.png]]\n\n### Related interested links\n\n-   Conversations: [Celeste Headlee: The Dying Art of Conversation](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/celeste-headlee/)\n-   Common knowledge at different scales: [Shtetl-Optimized » Blog Archive » Common Knowledge and Aumann’s Agreement Theorem](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2410)\n-   Common knowledge at different scales: [The Costly Coordination Mechanism of Common Knowledge - LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge#Startups)\n\n# External links\n\n"

This theory still holds true in our technological age of hyperconnectivity, despite the capacity to have hundreds and even thousands of 'friends' on social media sites. Dunbar's number implies that humans are still limited in how many meaningful relationships they can maintain, and that it is impossible to maintain genuine relationships with an infinite number of people. This is not to say that social media sites cannot be used to form meaningful connections, but that there is a limit to how many of these connections an individual can maintain\n\n\n\n![a cybernetic symbiosis of a single engineer astronaut mech-organic eva suit made of pearlescent wearing knitted shiny ceramic multi colored yarn thread infected with diamond 3d fractal lace iridescent bubble 3d skin dotted covered with orb stalks of insectoid compound eye camera lenses floats through the living room, film still from the movie directed by Denis Villeneuve with art direction by Salvador Dalí, wide lens,kevlar,carbon fiber,ceramics,gaseous materials,](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0a210b4c-f330-4221-98c6-47dac4c35041)\n\n\n>Of course, at the Village stage, the company likely exceeds **Dunbar’s number** (the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships), and the founder simply won’t have time to meet one on one with every employee with any reasonable frequency\n>~ [[Reid Hoffman - Reid Hoffman - Blitzscaling - The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies - libgen.li|Reid Hoffman]].\n\n\nDunbar's number is a concept that suggests that the human mind is limited in its capacity to keep up with the exponential growth of technology. As technology advances, the number of relationships and connections that a person is able to maintain also increases, leading to potential social and cognitive overload. The concept of Dunbar's number raises concerns about the human ability to manage these increased levels of connectivity and the potential for an overall decrease in the quality of human relationships. It is an important issue to consider in the midst of a rapidly changing technological landscape, as it is necessary to maintain a balance between using technology in a way that enriches our lives and avoiding the potential for negative consequences on both our personal and professional relationships.\n\n\n![distorted perspective extremely detailed movie still of a distorted mirror maze by denis villenueve, ultra wide angle, trippy, wavy, 4 d ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/034ea5f4-0a7f-43f1-8092-5a7a1eba25e2)\n\n"

We must have the radio or books or talking, incessant chatter about this and that, about art and culture. So we come to that point when we know there is this extraordinary sense of selfisolation. We may have a very good job, work furiously, write books, but inwardly there is this tremendous vacuum. We want to fill that and dependence is one of the ways. We use dependence, amusement, church work, religions, drink, women, a dozen things to fill it up.\n>~ [[Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurti]]\n\n\n\n\n![motherhood, concept art, dramatic lighting, blunt borders, rule of thirds ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0a698898-4b86-41a7-8d87-f33b3611df65)\n\n\n\n\n\n>When insecurity creeps into dependency, as it inevitably does, then that particular relationship is cast aside and a new one taken on in the hope of finding lasting security; but there is no security in relationship, and dependency only breeds fear. Without understanding the process of security and fear, relationship becomes a binding hindrance, a way of ignorance.

I believe in something, or I hold on to an ideal, and that gives me great comfort; but remove the ideal, remove the belief, and I am lost. It is the same thing with a guru. I depend because I want to receive, so there is the ache of fear. Again, it is the same when you depend on your parents or teachers. It is natural and right that you should do so when you are young; but if you keep on depending when you have grown to maturity, that will make you incapable of thinking, of being free.

The very word seduction implies trickery and manipulation. ~ [[Matt Ridley]]\n\n\nhttps://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/the-9-archetypal-lovers-you-are-attracted-to\n\n## 1. The Siren\n\nThe Siren is of highly charged traditionally-feminine energy and tends to attract those of a completely opposite, traditionally-masculine energy. Whether or not you identify as male, female or neither, you'll tend to be attracted to a Siren when you show characters on the extremes of traditionally-male behaviour.\n\n————————\n\n_*NOTE*_\n\n_I absolutely hate using the words feminine and masculine because of the connotations behind each. When we think feminine, we think of the female sex, and when we think of masculine, we think of the male sex. However, feminine and masculine or just two ends of a behavioural spectrum, regardless of sex or gender. Just know that from now on, do not envision a traditional-female figure when I say feminine/female, and do not envision a traditional-male figure when I say masculine/male. Whatever you identify as, you hold both male and female behaviours and energy._\n\n————————\n\nFor example, when you show rigidity, high responsibility, almost a coldness and the need for control in things, the Siren is your opposite. The Siren plays on society's oppression of your inner desire for personal pleasure and play, most notably through your senses.\n\nThink Cleopatra and Marilyn Monroe. These Sirens were attractive because of their ability to bring out a heightened masculine feeling in those they came in contact with. Cleopatra brought exoticism and a sense of godly masculinity to both Julius Ceasar and Mark Antony (and probably many others), and Marilyn Monroe brought a sense of masculine danger and pleasure to Joe DiMaggio and John F Kennedy  (and probably many others).\n\n We're attracted to, and actively try to attract, Sirens when we secretly just want to let go. When society needs us to be a strong rock, an emotionless stoic with many a responsibility, the Siren attracts us with their lure of opposing behaviour we desperately long for.\n\nThink back to your past crushes. Were you attracted to them because they made you feel extra masculine? Did they dangle a life of ease and little responsibility in your strict day-to-day affairs?\n\nThe trouble with Sirens is their ability to bring out laziness for short-term pleasure.  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Siren:**\n\n1.  Do not let your character suffer.\n    \n2.  Keep an open understanding of what you plan to do with your life.\n    \n3.  Never forget your life plan and do not let yourself be distracted for minimal pleasure.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 2. The Rake\n\nThe Rake is characterized as the masculine Siren. Playing on society's roles that a female character must abide by, the Rake brings out the oppressed behaviours of a traditionally-femine figure. They bring out the excited feminine in us. Again, male, female, or neutral, we're attracted to Rakes when we've been too confined and comfortable - too restrained - too neutral and unenergized in our day-to-day lives. \n\nFor example, when we've grown accustomed to the office banter, the politically correct and neutral acceptance of things and our banal schedules, the Rake stirs things up and makes us feel special. The Rake is guided by his enflamed passion for you at the expense of others, and gives you the thrill of hot romance. Like the Siren, they strive to help you let go of responsibilities in favour of in-the-moment pleasure. No talk of future responsibilities.\n\nWhere the Siren attracts with visual sensuality, the Rake attracts with linguistic sensuality. The Rake is a master of language, communicative influence, and poetic verbiage. Often times, we may know we aren't going anywhere mature with a Rake, but that's what makes them so attractive. They are the heat of the moment and give us some texture in our  dull lives. They could pull a casanova and hide in a closet until you're alone for the pleasurable taking. \n\nThink Don Juan (or JGL's Don Jon), Christian Grey, or Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl. They'll say and do anything to get us to fall for them, and they're able to do so because we've been so bored. Again, the majority of their attractiveness comes from their words, but it is the colourful and dangerous imagery they paint in our minds that become our daydreams.\n\nThe trouble with Rakes is their tendency to over-exaggerate their love and insinuate improbable fantasies of lasting partnership.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Rake:**\n\n1.  Do not let your character suffer.\n    \n2.  Let them know of your life plans, and hold them accountable if they hold you back.\n    \n3.  Do not let yourself be hypnotized by their current words of pleasure. Keep track of their actions.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents. \n    \n\n---\n\n## 3. The Ideal Lover\n\n The Ideal Lover comes to us from our childhood dreams, or rather our lost dreams. They are the ones that bring a hopeless fantasy to life with their ability to mirror the ideals we once had as  innocent happy-go-lucky children, but have lost to grey world. They are highly astute at understanding our deepest desires and definitions of affection and bring them to fruition.\n\nWhatever it may be, the Ideal Lover takes [the time to fully understand you and empathize with you](https://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/10-books-every-power-couple-needs-to-read). They play the long game. They study you and question you while giving you a sense of affectionate attention. And then they'll play your deepest desires to their advantage, accentuating the ideals you long for. They either show your desired ideals in themselves, or they try to make those ideals appear in you. \n\nWhen this happens, we're hooked. We see a filling of a forgotten desire in them, with them, and through them. Often a chivalrous knight or a motherly damsel, or something completely different, they come to the rescue out of nowhere with a romanticized but real idea of love. \n\nThink Casanova, and John F Kennedy. Kennedy notably took the helm of a nation longing for lost ideals and future hope -- the epitome of the Ideal Lover. Tony Robbins does this with his clients, Gary Vaynerchuk with his entrepreneurial following, and Andy Warhol with his artistic subjects -- they were always painted in the most hopeful light. The trick of the Ideal Lover is their ability to know what \"hope\" looks like to different people. \n\nOn the other hand, the trouble with Ideal Lovers is their grandiose self-image and lack of ability to operate within the realms of reality. Their high ideals are the culprit of this, and if left unchecked, can get too out of hand.\n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with an Ideal Lover:**\n\n1.  Allow for their hope and ideas of growth, but also keep a firm grounding on reality.\n    \n2.  Keep open communication for your life plans.\n    \n3.  Remember they are only human and are not godlike myths - be cautious with their proposals and plans.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Dandy\n\nThe Dandy is the Siren or the Rake of the same sex. They attract the traditionally-male with psychologically masculine traits, and they attract the traditionally-female with psychologically feminine traits. They tear down the labels that society has put on sexuality and they play in all spaces. We're attracted to Dandies for their ambiguous and obscure personas, and their freedom to break prejudice sexual behavioural roles.\n\nSince humans are a social creature, our societies will always tend towards a general acceptance of values in order to keep everyone in place. Dandies defy this and let themselves explore multiple perspectives, especially those perspectives that are not accepted by society. \n\nOften mysterious and unable to predict, Dandies spark our interest when we have repressed desires for freedom. Their lack of conformity to the masses is such an attractive characteristic that we all want a piece of. The fact that they easily flaunt it -- whether through their clothing, opinions, or overall behaviour -- is something to be jealous of in itself. Why not try to obtain this freedom for ourselves? \n\nFlamboyant males and rigid females are the popular images that come to mind. Think Rudolph Valentino and Lou Andreas-Salomé. The masculine Dandy and the feminine Dandy. They cast spells on the opposite gender using their same behaviours. Valentino had a very feminine-described etiquette and appearance, and Salomé had very rigid independent habits. They attracted their lovers by showing how free they were to act like their lovers.\n\nAs progressive as these types sound, their strong ability to relate to you could also lead to troubles. Power struggles may be an issue since you'd most likely be sharing similar fields of work or goals. Another is the inevitable case of [unconditional acceptance -- we come to expect them to understand us fully without even speaking, and can only lead to miscommunication.](https://aarondanielfilms.com/blog/the-secret-to-mature-and-accepting-relationships)\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Dandy:**\n\n1.  Take inspiration from their free-spiritedness, but do not forget your responsibilities and the others you need.\n    \n2.  As you share similar fields of interest, do not deliberately try to outshine each other. It's not a competition.\n    \n3.  Do not let yourself be swayed by their indifference or unconcern for others. Always treat others respectfully.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 5. The Natural\n\nThe Natural is a reflection of those golden years of comfort and innocent affection - childhood. They portray what both Kubrick and Freud would describe as 'uncanny'. Familiar yet strange. The Natural brings into their persona a sense of youthfulness in an adult body, drawing those that long for the times of no responsibilities, harmlessness, and naive spontaneity.  \n\nWe miss those times and the Natural brings it back to us. Their child-like mannerisms and kind of weakness is something that attracts us. They draw out sympathy in us through their subconscious actions of needing protection. They probably won't say it outright or explicitly ask you for motherly/fatherly-ness, but it's their openness for affection and protection that draws us so close and dear.\n\nThey represent a world we've all left behind, and to some, we see this as a doorway back to that playroom. The Natural mainly draws upon 4 characteristics that we are attracted to: innocence, blissful unawareness, spontaneous talent/skill, or openness. All 4 are key indicators of a Natural and can seem endearing to be around.\n\nThink Charlie Chaplin, Paul McCartney, Lil Yachty, Ryan Reynolds. They all emit this aura of youth that falls on us with an almost intoxicating feeling. A self awareness and openness in their sincerity. They don't even try to act like the other adults. While everyone hits us with a seriousness and strict adulthood-ness, it's the Natural people that calm our senses and ease our anxieties of needing to be an overly cautious grownup. Because if they can succeed this far as a child, why can't we?\n\nThe common obstacle while dealing with Naturals is their tendency to be too childish. Their innocence and naiveté can easily turn into irritation as you start to feel too much like a parent. When you can't talk to them on an equal level and start to baby them, a sense of annoyance and irritability may start to arise.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Natural:**\n\n1.  Treat life with a light heart, but keep yourselves aware of your responsibilities as growing individuals.\n    \n2.  Do not take the role of mother/father and child. Set your boundaries and expectations for one another.\n    \n3.  Find \"adult things\" to do and enjoy together. Don't rely on childhood memories to bring joy.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 6. The Coquette\n\nThe Coquette is hot and cold. They touch and go. They attract you with hopeful words or sensual maneuvers and then step back and distance themselves from you. They entice you and frustrate you at the same time, and we're attracted to this because of our human nature to want what we can't have.\n\nThey tease us. This may seem like an obvious unattractive trait, but the reason they spark any sort of infatuation is because of their ability to plant a seed of desire in our minds that continues to grow without them needing to be there. Consciously or subconsciously, they've come to understand what we desire, and insinuate that they are the solution to our desires -- all without being present.\n\nThey are the ultimate tease because it is in their psychological enchantment that takes hold of our A) hoping for their surrender to us, and B) the thought that we can be just as independent. With the former, it is so common for both men and women to fawn over people they know they can't have or know they shouldn't have  -- the grass is always greener on the other side. With the latter, much like the Dandy, we want to be in the presence of someone just as carefree and unworried about the consequences of their actions -- and the Coquette does just that, showing little acknowledgement for us and giving hope that maybe we can have little worry for consequence as well.\n\nThink Josephine de Beauharnais, John Mayer, Ginger from Casino, and every bachelor on The Bachelor. They dangle the love carrot on a stick in front of us, but never fully give it to us. They use the virtue of delayed satisfaction to their advantage. And this is exciting to us because we know how independent they are, but there's just that bit of hope that they could be dependent on us. And that satisfies both our human need for wanting what we can't have _and_ our human need to feel significantly special. Coquettes are like a shadow we cannot grasp but are always lingering behind us.  \n\nThe obvious downside is their unreliability. They may show bouts of deep affection and loyalty to us (which gives us some of the biggest excitements and joys we can feel), but on the whole they are difficult to tame and keep within our needs.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Coquette:**\n\n1.  Set the expectations. Right from the start. If you're willing to play hot and cold, let them know and let yourself know.\n    \n2.  Do not fall for their words or small acts of compassion -- keep a general tally of how reliable they act\n    \n3.  Keep a firm grasp of your needs and never settle.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n##  7. The Charmer\n\nThe Charmer has almost a devilish smile you're willing to swoon over. The word \"charm\" comes from the Latin \"carmen\" -- a song or a chant that is synonymous with a magic spell. To charm is to literally cast a spell on another. The way that they do this, and the reasons we fall for them, is because they understand 3 fundamental laws of human nature: The law of narcissism, the law of defensiveness, and the law of grandiosity. It's our egos that they stroke, our vanity emotional walls that they align with, and our self-esteem that they praise.\n\nSimilar to the Ideal Lover, they make us feel special by playing on our deepest emotions and bringing them into warm light. They make us feel like the center of attention, bring us personalized pleasure, diffuse any conflict, relax us from chaos while keeping themselves cool, and have the skills/resources to help us in other areas of our lives. They are the embodiment of a prince/princess charming.\n\nOpposite the Ideal Lover, however, is that they actively try to repress any signs of sexuality or signs of overt romantic tension. They give us a bit of Coquette-like distance and confusion in terms of romance, while at the same time bringing Ideal Lover behaviour. This makes them seem extra valuable because we suspect that no others are able to hold them like we can. **_\"Wow he/she makes me feel so special, and he's a little shy too. I think I can own him/her like no one else can.\"_**\n\nThink Drake, George Clooney, the Obamas, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jessica Alba, Amanda Seyfried, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt. Well put-together, witty and affectionate in their comments, obviously able to connect with higher-class individuals, _and_ knows how to keep it G rated. The family man or woman that show hints of tackling danger.\n\nThe obstacle with Charmers is in their ability to hide or subdue the less-clean history of their character. Everyone has their dark sides, and it's when we forget this that makes us susceptible to assuming their holiness. Sure, they can have an excellent track record, but understand that we are all human and have the ability to make mistakes.\n\n  \n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Charmer:**\n\n1.  Set expectations for what you two are looking for. Don't expect they'll be able to love you unconditionally.\n    \n2.  Do not fully rely on them for your complete happiness - they can only give so much and you need to keep self-reliance\n    \n3.  Thoughts of being \"too good to be true\" could lead you to suspicion, but don't let this hinder your ability to love\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 8. The Charismatic\n\nThe Charismatic is the excitement in the room. They exude confidence and energy in all the right places. They are mesmerizing and we're attracted to them because of their sincere obsessions and opinions and actions. They glow a sense of charisma with their animated gestures and fiery persuasive voice. And if they fit our values, they're just a good time to be around. \n\nThey have a definite purpose in life, and seem to spread their campaign in the most eloquent, magnetic and theatrical way. It's hard not to be attracted to such people because they give us a sense of purpose through osmosis. If we lose sight of a meaningful life, it's their charismatic energy that makes us believe in ourselves once again. They are the light in the dark.\n\nAnd with this, it is easy to be swayed and influenced by them. They have such a strong belief in themselves its hard to find flaws in their plans or their character. Similar to the Charmer of hope, the Charismatic brings intensified energy to their own hopes and tends to make you believe in them as well - which leads us to being more reliant and believing in their cause/values.\n\nThink Gary Vaynerchuk, Grant Cardone, Will Smith, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Robin Williams, Jackie Chan. Their invigorating tone and influence gets to you. Plus they have a strong sense of awareness like the Charmer for cooling things down when need be. There's a lot of entrepreneurial bloggers and youtubers that praise charisma, and rightly so -- it does the job. But there are some obstacles that should be examined.\n\nSuch obstacles include their saviour-like attitude and prophetic fervour. We're attracted to them at first because of this, but in the long-term, this gallant behaviour leads to fatigue. Psychologists call this 'erotic fatigue', when the feelings of passion are asking for too much of our energy and eventually lead to feelings of resentment. Yes, too much love is exhausting. This leads us to irritability. It's our responsibility to control this.\n\n  \n\n﻿**To tackle and grow maturely with a Charismatic:**\n\n1.  Be open to their affectionate hope, but keep a firm grip of your own values.\n    \n2.  Understand that they are not superhumans and don't always have the right answers. Think carefully of their actions.\n    \n3.  Keep open communication when it comes to the amount of energy you need, you give, and that you must recharge.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 9. The Star\n\nThe Star is almost (or completely is) of celebrity status. They, like the Natural, poses the powers of the uncanny -- specifically mixing reality and myth. The star is a dream come true. Physically present, but almost legendary and mythic in essence. They are almost too dream-like to picture in front of us. We imagine them too far out of our league, and that is what makes them so attractive.\n\nThey have a strong reputation as something surreal and superior to our understanding of day-to-day life. They attract us with their Hollywood-esque aura, but also with their down-to-earth ability to relate to us. They're up there with the stars, but close enough to come in contact with. Not too out of our reaches.\n\nTo most, having a crush on a star-like individual may seem natural and obvious. But digging deeper, we can attribute this attraction to our own seemingly-boring, too-natural, banal and too real of a life. Like all the other archetypal lovers, we're attracted to them because we lack what they have. And they have out-of-this-world type lives. Or at least portray it.\n\nThink of any celebrity. Any performing musician. Any touring author. Any interviewed actor/actress. They have attention and adventure plastered all over their perceived schedules, and we want that. Especially in this Instagram / YouTube / Facebook / Netflix / Snapchat era of showing off. When we see their following on social media, we want a piece of that for ourselves, and that's what makes them so attractive to our plain lives.\n\nAlthough the Star may have a clean and bright reputation, your dynamic with them will also include some overlooked setbacks. Like the Dandy, you may come to fight for attention. Like the Charismatic, you may come to exhaustion with their affection. Like the Coquette, you may feel frustrated with their independence. I can only imagine how frustrating an actual celebrity's family must get when they're bombarded with the paparazzi (though could also be invigorating from time to time).\n\nWe all have our crushes from the movies, but think deeply about what it must be like being their partner.\n\n**To tackle and grow maturely with a Star:**\n\n1.  Come up with clear expectations for each other's needs for affection.\n    \n2.  Understand that you both still have your own dedicated circle of friends/family and accept each other's growth with others.\n    \n3.  Stay supportive of each other's goals and remember that no one can bring support in the same way that you do for them.\n    \n4.  You have so much love to offer the world, do not stunt your talents.\n"

You also have to shift from sharing all information by default to deciding on what is secret and what is shareable. If you don’t manage to develop an effective internal communications strategy, your organization will become disjointed and start to fall apart\n>~ [[Reid Hoffman - Blitzscaling]]\n\n\nIn today's world, communication is one of the most important aspects of any relationship, especially romantic relationships. With the nonlinearly growing velocity of information, it can be difficult to keep up with the dynamics of a relationship. Implementing a communication menu helps to bridge the gap by allowing both partners to stay on the same page and to communicate what is important to them in the relationship. It can help to ensure that both partners feel heard and respected, and that any issues are addressed promptly. It also allows for the relationship to grow in a healthy and positive manner, ensuring both partners are satisfied and happy with the relationship.\n\n\n\n![one olive - skinned man and one woman kissing, painting by van gogh ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/0f625086-831f-4e83-915b-e28b0e444b1f)\n\n\nCommunication is also essential to friendships. Implementing a communication menu can help bridge this gap by allowing both friends to stay on the same page and to communicate what is important to them in the friendship.

The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim - for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives - is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.\n>~ [[George Orwell]]\n# External links"

Same for health, everyone has their preferences, to explore…\n\nQuestions that came to my mind:\n\n- Does it make sense for me to join this event? [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/demo-day-2022-after-party-vision-health-pioneers-incubator-in-person-tickets-415981079607](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/demo-day-2022-after-party-vision-health-pioneers-incubator-in-person-tickets-415981079607)\n- Runway?\n- What’s the salary of everyone (if you don’t mind), maybe equities?\n- For the next steps in the process, you mentioned discussing culture/values if I remember correctly? We can meet again soon, maybe for a longer duration. Personally, I like walking conversations (for hours), the brain works better."

If you have a physical office, how much would you want to work from home?\n\nIs it possible to build a wildly successful company without burning out or damaging other parts of your life (family, health, etc.)?\n\nIs there anything I should know that may affect materially affect your time or legal status as a founder? (e.g. visa, green card, criminal record)\n\nWill this company be your primary activity? Do you have any other time commitments?\n\nWhat is your expected time commitment right now? How do you see that changing in the next 6 months? 2 years? 5 years?\n\nHow much money should we raise?

How have each of our capabilities and approach contributed to growth failures in our pasts?\n\nIn every partnership, there are times when a partner might breed resentment if certain dissatisfactions don’t change over time.

Quality > quantity though. I track my time using some software and the data match my words. I stop working when my energy is too low and not worthwhile trying more. In my experience, for example, for programming, in a low energy mode result in bad code.\n\nBetween 9 am and 7 pm. No opinion on remote yet. I don't mind working on both/either saturday and sunday, I try to enforce one day of very different activity though.\n\nIDK, I have the feeling that EU is the middle age of tech, so I would say US.\n\nHalf of the time. I also like the idea of booking a Airbnb somewhere random on the planet with a team & run sprints (same for onboarding new ppl)\n\nI rarely compromise my health. Irrational\n\nFrench. Minor details, I like to visit few doctors in France once two years - post-Leukemia (at 13')\n\nYes. I enjoy building random programming/science/ai projects on weekend sometime but I can skip this if necessary.\n\n100%. I will need a salary in <6 months (been surviving without salary for almost 2 years now). I wouldn't say no to do some angel investing if I have capital in the late future.\n\nGo big or go home\n\n10 year mission\n\nAbort\n\nEnvironment design - shaping my environment with people I like. Solve a big problem & bring value (to define). Why now? I have been trying for almost 2 years now and building (non business) projects on night & weekend for the past 12 years\n\nBeing surrounded by great people that are aligned on my values - entrepreneurs & scientists. Brought large scale value & impact. Enough financial comfort to stop over optimizing my expenses, while still living under my means\n\nIf it's best for the mission I'll resign\n\nEqual split for the sake of maintaining long term motivation across all participants. Eventual, rare, exception if a cofounder has much less experience (I don't give a shit if someone has put more or less effort at start, it's a long-term game). I'm quite ignorant in employee equity pool, I'd say great people play long-term games and so require equity.\n\nIt's more of a fair agreement, if someone is unhappy about someone else, we talk, doesn't make sense to keep an unhealthy relationship for anyone\n\nRunway: < 6 months depending on where I live. Burn rate < $1500/month depending on where I live. I can invest $1K, to discuss\n\nsurvive: 1500, comfortable: 2000, then, IDK never thought about it\n\nhave a walk 1-to-1, put your ego away, be radically honest, cry & grow stronger\n\nWe have a 1-1 every week between each founders where we discuss \"what was good & what was bad\" about the relationship. An alternative is \"give four praises and one criticism\". (Work well in my experience)\n\nDo we have a skill bottleneck that this cofounder can fill? Or bring a new perspective on the mission & execution?\n\nUse most of their energy and then go home\n\nAccountability buddy like. OKR. Numbers. Maybe Continuous Discovery (applied to career)\n\nI don't want to work with someone I wouldn't hangout with\n\nI think gender diversity is interesting as men & women have very different kind of intelligence, at least 30% female. Of course not sacrificing skill & passion for the mission\n\n2\n\n1: Technology and the information to process is nonlinearly increasing 2: Conversations are misaligned and too noisy\n\nNear B2C / tarpit start-up. UX\n\nGeneral: fullstack tech, start-up experience, techstars status, top 10% YC start-ups. INTJ. 1: Years of knowledge management experiments, 500k words on obsidian. 2: Years of thinking and building products to fix conversations.\n\nCEO/COO to fix my weaknesses, business ppl\n"

Interesting, I don't know many communists, are you vegan?\n\nWhat do you mean by hobby freaks? Is it people actively seeking personal growth that you mean?\n\nCan you expand on what you mean by consumption?\n\nThat’s an interesting idea, I heard a similar idea from Nassim Taleb (read all his books many times, kind of funny guy)([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemocracy))\n\nI don't know if it matters if I liked the answer, I think we are interested in similar communities, so I would say yes.\n\nFor me, I'm a little confused, I used to be part of the hacker and programmer communities, but they tend to be one-dimensional, unfortunately. I was active in the community https://fs.blog for several years and learned a lot from them: rationality, business, etc. At one point I left the community for a few months because it wasn't transhumanist enough for me (older generations, too far from AI), but I went back in the end, I couldn't find a better replacement. Lately, I've been trying to get more involved in the https://www.lesswrong.com community which contains a lot of non-conformist thinkers, as well as https://www.effectivealtruism.org which is a close community, more ethically oriented.\n\nI'm getting more and more involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, unfortunately, Paris is not the right place for that, or I haven't been to the right place, the last time I went to San Francisco I loved it, I went to an event on cryogenics, and it was a house where ~50 people lived and worked in start-ups, FAANG, researchers, etc.\n\nBasically, my ideal community:\n\n- Multidimensional people with a strong curiosity / epistemic hunger towards science (i.e. generalists who are interested not only in what they do on a daily basis, their work, but also in the wide range of possibilities we are given).\n- People seeking daily personal growth measured by numbers, seeking discomfort, strong epistemic humility and rationality.\n- The above two points necessarily create: ethics, financial improvement (trying to exchange money for time rather than time for money)\n\nI hope to create such a community in Berlin, but hope is not enough, I have to prepare a plan.\n\nDo I have a list of questions? I have questions, yes, and I tend to have a more elaborate structure to discover people. I don't know if I told you, but I built https://langa.me, that's where I create and store my questions, the interface is not very good because I don't have time to update it, but it works for me. All questions are generated by AI.\n\nActually, we’re just getting started on the easy questions, usually I do \"big talk\" with people I know already, sometimes with strangers too!\n\nIt looks like the future but I dont know how reliable they are. Do you think it is crap?\n\nI haven't seen much communities that I aligned a lot. I have lived in a communist + vegan group and enjoyed a lot but people tend to have problems, always. I am aligned with the STEM geek community for sure, it is easy to communicate with: being rational and scientific approach makes things easier. We also share the common interests/enthusiasm which I believe is important for a community. Then comes community of explorers. This includes travelers/couchsurfers, those who questions new things and tries to answer, and hobby freaks (changing and trying a lot). I think if there is a community of people under these 2 categories, I can just fit in.\n\nMy ideal community would be > With people who dont rely on a lot of consumption, minimalist and pragmatist. Those who dont identify with strict ideologies and who rely on information/research/data instead. I think my ideal one looks like an elitist society where the elits give responsibility/ruling to who knows about an area/topic (experts) and rest of the community learns to respect them. Also, this community should always tend to question what is being a good person and acts in that sense. Ofc the fact that I feel aligned with the first group doesnt mean my ideal community will consist on them. I value and enjoy the diversity created by others (ie art). So activities of the community is quite free on the condition that they try their best on ethical side and good of the society (pragmatism).\n\nDid you like the answer? How about you?\n\nOne question: do you have a list of questions you ask before accepting a friend (\"the game\") or are those questions in your head nowadays and you like ideas from people? Because I time to time stuck on some open end questions and like to ask random people (stimes find a group of chilling people in the campus and disturb them). Both is quite nice as I already enjoy, especially thinking and learning about myself 😁"

Just like that community: they just liked the idea but were opposing on a lot of topics (there are many subgroups of communism). I don't know much about the history, as I am ignorant about politics outside of Turkey, and inside doesn't make me intellectual :) But communism is not a topic that I am planning to educate myself on.\n\nI read Marx and such but no deep thoughts on this, not really my main focus nowadays too.\n\nI am not vegan. I was vegetarian for 1 year but ended with iron and B12 deficiency. I should've got some supplies, as I bleed once a month, or lick Iron Man idk. But I also changed my mind about some issues concerning veganism. I don't feel like saving the planet (climate crisis) with my little meat consumption, or I don't feel like their ways of radiating veganism are correct. My way would be playing an active role in the production of artificial meat, as a chemist, molecular biologist etc. because this is the most logical and even easy solution. But this process took too much time. There could be problems in the marketing (set by meat companies), but not with the science part as we had the tools. From ethical parts, I am concerned, but not as much as before. I realized I have no problems with experimenting with animals. Nor do I believe that Earthlings should live with equal rights. I just believe that it could be possible one day, but not through usual methods, but with better alternatives easily integrated into our lifestyles. I just minimize my consumption to be a good citizen, and I am already very veggie based. Are you a vegan and what do you think on this topic?\n\nI am not vegan but I am considering trying. In fact, I eat vegan meals regularly. Some weeks I'm carnivorous, some weeks vegan. Today, it's about 40% vegan.\n\nNevertheless I am not very convinced by veganism without being very informed, I am not sure that it is more ecological, we make massive monoculture instead of domestication (which is particularly unhealthy for human food by the way)? Then for the ethical sides I'm not sure it's better, if we stop eating cows there won't be any more cows, that's all. Or can we reach a new stage of human culture that includes animals that are not particularly useful to us?\n\nBecause historically, the largest populations of animals are those that are useful to humans?\n\nFor me the biggest block to going vegan is the nutritional part, I am very careful with my diet and doubt how to get my healthy macro (protein) with a vegan diet, I am skeptical about protein powder, and likewise for the missing things that are present in meat, but maybe it is more correct to supplement (creatine, vitamins, etc.).\n\nHobby freaks, yes, kinda personal growth. More like those who try to experience as much as possible in life. This includes seeing places, trying different tastes, and then activities through different hobbies. Even when I was converting to vegetarian, I didn't stop myself from trying new meat. I have the priority for exploration, so the community of people with a lot of hobbies would be very suitable for me, even if this is not \"a thing\" as far as I know...\n\nConsumption... One example is dairy consumption, which we consume too extreme, bad for our health and planet. Then comes the transportation and personal devices. Even with books. I love having my own library but it feels more like a showoff, a waste of product (when e-books are affordable), and ethically wrong as there are schools to donate books. The list goes on... I found that I get along better with people who don't have a dependence on too many things, keep the money and sources for personal or populational development\n\nEpistemocracy, yes we are on the same line. One of my friends suggested following him on Twitter for the same reason. Maybe, I should, as we share some important ideas :)\n\nFrom your answer, I see that you can \"name\" the communities. For me, it has been more like finding people interested in the same topics and gathering them together. I have generated a friend group of science+maths people which grew into forming a student society where I could find people suiting my needs. I haven't heard of these options that I could find on the internet. Only found some discord groups that disappointed me. fs blog seems quite interesting. Most of my time I work with current-day topics and see them on social media so I wouldn't mind if the people and ideas are old. I enjoy reading ideas and collections of knowledge from people, ie. Montaigne, metascience, and phil. I think I will try reading sth there. Less Wrong > I don't even know the meaning of most of the topics under \"concepts portal\" :D I feel even more ignorant but better as still there is a lot to learn *-* I am familiar with the term effective altruism but never heard of the platform. It is good to see people trying to maximize goodness in the world and look for ways actively. Did you have an active role in it?\n\nNot at all, just exploring, but as I said to Kai, I don’t want to get too much into it as I want to focus on my main goals. My plan is to gradually get involved in more ethical projects as I reach financial success (to be defined), not before.\n\nI don't know about the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I remember you mentioned your dream house with researchers, startup founders, etc. living together. I think this is the main idea. But what drives you to this idea? Do you want to work together with these people while living with them at the same time? Or working is not a necessity, but the environment is? I would like to hear more about this.\n\nYou are the average of the five people around you. I would work and when I have free time hanging out with these people.\n\nInterested in new ways of living in general, new kinds of relationships, communication, and conversations.\n\nDaily growth \"measured by numbers\" and \"seeking discomfort\", can you explain these? I like to point \"exchange money for time\". It seems people who want to learn, do and experience a lot of things acknowledge this point but we are the minority and it is a pain to live in a society losing time for money. Even in my family house, I feel it often... But I cannot argue with people saying \"my precious time\" since they don't see the value of my time, and argue \"who are you to have precious time?\". OMG I am the most important person on this planet for myself and my time is the most valuable thing!\n\nI hope to get some good grades from your questions and to be invited to hang out with your community :d\n\nOk, no rush, small questions are also quite good, make me explore myself. I have questions too.You mentioned hacker programmer communities being one-dimensional and that money is for time. What is your master plan for spending your time being multi-dimensional at the same time? I think you are trying to maximize efficiency, but facing the human factor too. Do you think you are good at planning your life and do you get mad at yourself from time to time? This madness could be due to time on social media, imposter syndrome, psychological wellness (stress that you cannot control - but want to control, etc.). This is a topic that I am trying to improve myself and I have the idea that you know different ways to handle it.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the question, I'm trying different strategies to plan my life yes, using some sort of this ([https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58046715](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58046715))\n\nI have a [ouraring.com](http://ouraring.com/) that collects data on my health, I started a project to correlate my health data with my diet and how I spend my time ([timingapp.com](http://timingapp.com/)) (using code, automated)\n\nTrading money for time [https://twitter.com/naval/status/1049935100173942790?lang=en](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1049935100173942790?lang=en)\n\nGetting mad at myself? Good question, I think so, who doesn't? Uncertainty, difficulty making a decision, so a certain way of thinking can help, sometimes I don't know those ways. Making stupid mistakes, also. Hurting people not communicating properly.\n\nI don't really use social media, according to the definition, I use a little discord and some forums, WhatsApp and messenger.\n\nImposter syndrome, yes, the illusion of knowing something, lying to myself, maybe for fear of exposing my weaknesses.\n\nPsychological well-being? My human nature and all the baggage that comes with it, desires and prejudices.\n\nI like to draw my thoughts, as well as write them down, I like pictures as another dimension of (personal) conversation. Talking to people also helps me, maybe a kind of \"accountability buddy\". Do you know Atomic Habits?\n\nI play a game with friends, we have to praise and criticize each other (regularly). Some friends are more critical, others more complimentary."

            "note_content": "# 120922\n\n1. Good points about veganism. Farming is still way too harmful to the planet. Also, I think cows are too huge and useless (if we don't eat or milk), thus, probably there would be some wild cows, like deers, when the environment allows, or in zoos  But I don't think this is a close future. You are right to be concerned about the nutritional part. People born vegetarian have different genes which allow them to produce some nutrients from plants, i.e. FADS1 produces such enzyme, and possibly many more genes to be found. At this point, you cannot trust your body easily to go vegan and survive. I am also skeptical about protein powder and also some supplements, but this is a choice and trust issue in the end. \n\nI have noted the book on my Goodreads. Atomic Habits, I heard a lot but didn't read, I should. I also try to adapt my readings to my life. I have found a lot in many books even if they are unrelated (even if they don't aim to give you advice on how to live). One example in my mind is Algorithms to Live By. Furthermore, understanding life sciences and more and more stories from the history of science, the life of discoverers/scientists/inventors, and the basic principles and rules that govern nature can even guide me in how to live and plan my life. Other factors (psychological health, etc) apply to me ofc, but I am trying to find ways out: meditation and again reading to learn about the problem. And finally, I am trying to ask this question to people (that I find resemblance) to find different ways. Thank you for sharing \n\nI don't often my thoughts (possibly because I cannot draw explicitly) but I do watercolors when I have some emotions that are easier to explain than in words. What kind of drawings or pictures do you make about your thoughts or conversations? Just to understand as I have different images in my mind. A quick charcoal of a scene in your mind or maybe some schemes of your conversation? \nThe game is a nice idea, especiallyto do regularly.\n2. ***September 10, 2022 1:27 PM*September 10, 2022 1:27 PM*September 10, 2022 1:27 PM***Ouraring looks cool. I have heard this concept being developed before but didn't know it was realized and used. I can have one, maybe in the future, definitely better than a diamond ring xd\n3. ***September 10, 2022 1:30 PM*September 10, 2022 1:30 PM*September 10, 2022 1:30 PM***Are you in Berlin now? How is it? \nI have found my room but I will move in mid October. Still, it is very nice and has a little balcony facing a nice park. I hope I can sit there at least some weeks before it gets too cold. I could get very creative there ! \nI am arriving 21st Sep. If you will have time, we can meet after I arrive. I won't have much to do for 1 week, except for buying some stuff for the room and a computer. I have the feeling that you like buying tech stuff so I would appreciate if you help me choosing a computer\n\nMessage @oykur"

            "note_content": "# OoO\n\n> Have you set limits and a center to your territory? If so, what are they? If not, I warn you that you might spend your whole life seeking for completing your map without success (as the map would keep on expanding, and the center would keep on moving). Which makes me question Libertarism and wildering vs roots and framing!!\n> \n\nBy territory, I guess you meant map, the territory is independent of me, the territory is the objective reality, imagine a superintelligence looking at our universe.\n\nInteresting question, I think my center corresponds in a way to my broad goals in life, and I’ve been thinking regularly about this.\n\nI could send links to my Obsidian vault (all is public), but trying to explain it here will challenge the actual map of my goals, so, without going into details:\n\n**Knowledge**: I think understanding the world solves a lot of problems that we face every day. I love Jiddu Krishnamurti “You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing, and dance, and write poems, and suffer, and understand, for all that is life.”\n\n**Health**: a car with a broken engine can’t move forward.\n\n**Wealth**: trade money for time, not time for money, time is finite\n\nThe limitations of my map? I don't think you're talking about the existing gaps, I kind of see what you mean, I hope, and that's a good point, I know that humans are evolutionarily programmed to never be satisfied, i.e. it's not good for the genes for their survival machine to do nothing.\n\nAs we've said before, I'm still not sure we should fight our nature, but it's worth understanding. I had this conversation with my brother about artificial intelligence and emotions, and he seemed to suggest \"giving\" emotions to AI because life without emotions has no direction to go.\n\nMontaigne said\n\n> The mind that has no fixed aim loses itself, for, as they say, to be everywhere is to be nowhere.\n> \n\nIn a way intelligence is emotion, Yudkowsky criticizes people saying that becoming more rational is incompatible with emotions, right now I’m a bit confused about this topic and will need to think a bit more about it, still believe to be on the side of Yudkowsky, [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational).\n\nSo I don’t think my map should have limits, or rather my curiosity, i.e. my interest in expanding it, for the actual gaps and limits (what I don’t know), that’s something I’m trying to define more and more.\n\nWhat do you mean by Libertarism? Same thing for wildering and roots. Maybe I get what is framing, I’m not sure what to say about it.\n\n> How is the weather in the South? I really wanna visit Marseille sometime. I've checked Ardeche and it looks great. I'm envious.\nAs much as I'm enjoying the expat life, I sometimes wish I could have grandpas so that I can pay a visit to the French Countryside from time to time..\n> \n\nQuite warm, barely can go out during the day, I like “L’isle sur la sorgues” near my place, it’s kind of a mix of Paris and Venice.\n\nYeah, Ardeche seems to be the least civilized part of France, I like it from time to time, obviously not the best place to find like-minded people for me, but I have internet though. I like hanging out with my grandparents!\n\nFeel free to come anytime you want, of course\n\n> In case you come to Paris, I'd be so glad to hang out and spend time with you!\n> \n\nSame! BTW if everything goes well I’m going to share an apartment in Paris with Kai in July/August/September\n\nHahaha, so basically one year ago I could not come up with such a conversation starter, but playing with Langame feels like the AI taught me how to generate conversation starters with my mind (because of course the AI is a lot better than me at it, just try the exercise, pick a topic, try to generate a good conversation starter 😆).\n\nSo, as I said earlier, I believe that understanding thing makes everyone better off, so I kind of like these knowledge-oriented questions, it’s one of my top conversation starters right now 😛\n\n> 1- Unanswered questions are better than unquestionable answers. --YNH;\n> \n\nFirst thing I thought about this, 42, Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy… “What’s the meaning of it all” it’s the unexplored limit of the map, which can never be reached, it’s like America would move away while the explorers get closer to it.\n\n(btw is the school 42 name related to this book?)\n\n> 2- I'm following a therapy, and I learnt about the \"DEAR MAN\" therapy to make well expressed requests, and improve my communication: [https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want);\n> \n\nCool :), I’ll learn more about it, are you into meditation, maybe more spiritual stuff? I used to read quite spiritual stuff (Jed McKenna, Osho, Krishnamurti), though I tend to move toward more scientific stuff and less metaphysical, even though I think metaphysical/spiritual ideas can be useful (even if your goal is to discover quantum physics or whatever)\n\nHave you read Dale Carnegie book ([https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/](https://fs.blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/))? I listened to the audiobook like 10 times in a row a few months ago (still not grasping the whole thing) haha\n\n> 3- I randomly had an unpopular insight about money and its plus value. I've written a draft about it:\n> \n\nSo yeah I like a lot Naval Ravikant “trade money for time, not time for money, time is finite”, well what you said does not apply to me, I don’t like ordering food, I love cooking, and I highly value health and consider most modern nutrition very harmful. I don’t use uber usually in walkable cities like Paris, sometimes I walk 20 km during the day (without even noticing). On the other hand, in Bangkok, I’d use a lot of uber because it’s super messy and polluted (and super cheap).\n\nBut sure, Americans don’t walk because their cities are built for cars. (Big advantage of Europe vs America)\n\nYeah, let’s call on Thursday please pick up an hour here [https://calendly.com/louis030195/15min](https://calendly.com/louis030195/15min) \n\nHaha, I use VIM too but not for messages, do you use it for Google Keep & WhatsApp somehow? Pros/Cons? A bit skeptical, like people surfing the internet in the terminal, not very efficient but why not to protect oneself from the noise of the internet. Do you use vim on your phone?\n\nWell, that’s a lot of content sorry, haha"

I feel empathy for doctors who see children die every day, my doctor quit because of this, it's too hard.\n\nI think I'm doing better on the gratitude side, but still have some progress to make, I think it's easier to experiment with gratitude (and many other social changes) with new people, I've done it, and now I have to apply it to people closer to me.\n\nWhile we're at it, thanks again for our conversations, I hope we'll continue to discuss our problems, and help each other, really appreciate it 🙂"

She took it well, and I feel like I can be more honest and sincere with her about weather I want her to join or not in the next times.\n    I'm still working on the same project.

This would be my last C project in the curriculum, and then I'll start using only cpp.\n    \n    Awesome, really being honest and transparent with people always seems the best long-term choice IMHO\n    Also, I'm actually reading a book about solving these dysfunctions and being vulnerable, there are a lot of workshops around this in techstars program, and they recommended this book [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)\n    \n5. ***September 18, 2022 12:39 PM*September 18, 2022 12:39 PM*September 18, 2022 12:39 PM***How is life? I want an answer as detailed as it could get\n- techstars program is really full of learning, I see many start-up things overlap with “personal growth”, i.e. dealing with dysfunctions in relationships, being vulnerable, etc\n- We get coached by 8 different mentors a day from UVC investors, CEO coaches, to 5 billion dollar valued company founder\n- We kind of have difficult time in the team though, we are taking one month to explore an eventual pivot, for the following reasons: the market is not good enough, our targeted customers are mostly companies not making a lot of money, and we can’t build a billion-dollar company with that. Also, we don’t feel like deeply/purposefully connected to the problem we are solving and that might be a red flag to ensure long-term incentives. I personally feel ok to work on a problem like e-commerce, I consider any kind of problem-solving worthwhile, generating wealth and saving human life time anyway.\n- We’re exploring ideas according to problems that we faced during our lives, our culture, and values, each of us, I’m still pretty much interested in the B2C/social area, I think it’s where we can have a larger impact and bring the most value, especially conversations for me. The biggest problem is that B2C social is hard to make a business around, but nothing great comes out of comfort. Techstars CEO also highly dislikes B2C social, so it’s likely going more in B2B social/communication area.\n- There is still a bit of friction in the team, between me and Antoine only actually, we have such opposite personalities, but we are able to solve our problems. This week-end we had deep 2 days conversations, skipping all the start-up parties for this, it was interesting.\n- Beyond this, I meet a lot of crazy interesting ppl, like the [arweave.org](http://arweave.org) founder, very cool, super smart, very philosophical, deeply passionate, and dedicated. Surrounded by great people. I really like the techstars CEO, clear thinker, emphasizes purpose / “north star”, he always has a good answer to any question\n- Going to NCA demo day on Thursday, going to be weird as we’re tempted to pivot, and we’ve customers and investors around. We’re going to pitch the team first, I think we invested 1 year building strong relationships and that’s where most of our value lies.\n1. ***September 18, 2022 12:40 PM*September 18, 2022 12:40 PM*September 18, 2022 12:40 PM***\n    \n    Unrelatedly, I'm still willing to come to Berlin after coming back from holidays, and finishing another project.

Your podcasts and writings have inspired me to pursue my dreams and build a better future for myself and for humanity.\n\nI was a geeky kid, partly due to my grandfather having a passion for computers. When I was 13, I was diagnosed with leukemia. I struggled with the disease, seeing other kids not making it. I went through all sorts of physical pain, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Finally, my brother gave me his bone marrow and saved my life.\n\nAfterward, I had to struggle psychologically to get reformatted into society. I was the cancer kid at school. I went into computer science, but I wasn't very motivated. I just felt like it was my best skill.\n\nBut then, at 20 years old, I dropped everything and dedicated 90% of my time to building things with code for fun at night and on weekends. I started listening to your podcast on the Knowledge Project, and I kept listening and following everything you posted on the internet. Slowly, the seed of entrepreneurship began to grow in me. I began to dream of taking responsibility for my actions and creating a fantastic future for humanity.\n\nAfter working for the French CIA during my studies, and then briefly in the cloud industry, I dropped everything to pursue entrepreneurship. Today, I started a batch at [techstars.com](http://techstars.com/) a few days ago, and I've grown so much in many dimensions. I love reading so much. I read anything non-fiction and science every day. I'm truly passionate about biology, physics, philosophy of science, and mind. I love discovering the nature of everything.\n\nI'm so grateful for everything you've shared. You will always be a hero in my mind.\n\nI wish you the best life you could possibly have.\n\nLouis"

I will create a yep.so page of this idea to validate that people would pay for it, if yes we probably will do it, shouldn't take too much effort beside the physical product - [https://yep.so/p/to-the-point](https://yep.so/p/to-the-point)\n- We're going to apply to YC with Ben (and maybe Daan) before the deadline on the 18 nov (with some random idea, they contacted me for Langame as top 10% startup a month ago but I didn't answer)\n\n---\n\ninvestment\n\nstable cofounder relationship\n\ninvestment need +1 year working together\n\nstability funding team\n\nreg calls\n\npitch deck\n\nvalue prop\n\nnetwork\n\nbatch ts\n\n---\n\nHe offers regular calls with me for pitch deck, value prop, network stuff\nSuggested getting in next Techstars batch with new idea"

Some dates but nothing interesting, in Thailand I had 100 matches/day but I don't like acting nice just to have sex while they expect long-term relationship\n\nMy last serious relationship was 6 years ago (about 1.5 years) - it was kinda random relationship, no common interest, mainly physical support\n\n[https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Psychology/Sex](https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Psychology/Sex)\n\nI agree with homosexuality, I have better intellectual activities with men but I am not interested in homosexual intimacy. I think I should try someday but it's really not something that attract me theoretically \n\nI think homosexuality makes it easier to have a very similar partner but I'm not sure it's a good thing, the Red Queen effect tells us that it's better to have a different partner that help us fixing our blind spots “to create all by oneself a spiritual, intellectual, and physically similar replica of oneself: the perfectly individualized self-perpetuation or immortality symbol.” (Ernest Becker on the Greek interest in homosexuality)\n\nI like the direction my relationship is going, as a kind of accountability partner challenging eachother to grow\n\nOn the other I'm a bit scared that she is also anxious avoidant. Her parents are dead and it's probably related\n\nAlso I often feel a strong connection with people that got fucked hard by life, like my with leukemia\n\nOverall I think I don't have as much experience as you in romantic relationship to fully grasp the potential of non monogamy. Most of my relationships were pure sex\n\nAnd maybe it emerge from that that I dislike your mindset regarding romantic relationship. I feel like you see a relationship in a very transactional and mechanistic viewpoint Todo fix\n\nHave you thought about a potential brain connection with a partner\n\nUsing current technology, obsidian and biotech sensors\n\nShare TS Berlin program\n\nMy understanding of your multiplayer romantic relationship is that you believe that a many to many relationship is a better optimization algorithm that a one to one relationship regarding your life goals\n\nWhat is the maximum scale, how many men and women can be involved in etc"

You probably agree, since you built Character ;).\n\nIt’s unlikely to find interesting people on Couchsurfing, but I did find my current partner and a great friend there [https://couchsurfing.com](https://couchsurfing.com/). It's mainly a community of travelers or people who want to escape society.\n\n[https://meetup.com](https://meetup.com/) is interesting for dating if you want to meet a partner with similar non-professional interests, in my opinion. For example, science.\n\nAll the popular dating apps have only brought me exercise in bed, honestly, sometimes I prefer to read a book. I can't deny that sometimes some physical intimacy is great.\n\nSo from our discussion, I get the impression that you're exploring non-monogamy mainly because you couldn't find a partner that met your expectations?\n\nWhat are your expectations?\n\nHave you ever considered non-monogamy as a multi-person relationship, maximizing the needs of each person? Is this even possible or too difficult to align?\n\nHow many romantic relationships have you had in the past 24 months?\n\nHave you ever considered homosexuality? What do you find interesting about men?

I’m terrified by social expectations, I believe it slows down one’s growth, it adds so much friction. People expect that you act in some way, so it’s more difficult to experiment with new things. Maybe I’m wrong.\n\nI think it is related to what you mentioned, loss of independence. I don’t want to rely on anyone, and I don’t want anyone relying on me.\n\nI am also extremely radical in my diet, and it often adds friction in a social environment. Also, some kind of foods that are very nutritious is not dating-friendly, and I’ll have to find an alternative (garlic, fermented food, etc.)\n\nHonestly, it’s been 6 years since I didn’t have a serious relationship, and 2 years I didn’t have sex, I’m pretty much rusty now. Ah and I was wondering if any kind of “sex classes” existed, because it’s hard to learn sex in books.\n\nOn another note, I am seeing a few girls one-to-one recently but I don’t consider it dates, I hope it’s not date, I wouldn’t practice nonmonogamy if it’s not consented by my partner. It kind of resonate with my will to follow the Silver rule, not doing to others what I don’t want to be done on me.\n\nOther questions unrelated,\n\nWhen are you in Berlin?

I am in the process of developing a new habit of practicing math in this direction.\nI'm lucky to have my brother as a kind of teacher for this, he's a senior ML engineer at youtube/google and runs [laion.ai](http://laion.ai/). My personal search engine for AI information :p\nHe also has ambitions to build AGI for a while, but probably not very developed.\nI see a future where we all work together to solve this problem.\n\n`I would love to talk to you more about relationships since I have only started the relationship game 2 years ago when I was 26.

People like you and me are hard to find, and I can imagine we can build great things in the future together, or just learn from each other on how to get there.` I Can not disagree, I think I have extremely rarely a strong personality match, so I want to introduce you to my friend Kai as I said who is also in our \"personality space\". I also want to build something together, but maybe not in the short term, I mean we still have a long life ahead of us, and I am patient. I met a really interesting girl with whom I have a strong personality match (crazy lucky these days) and I'm very interested in joining her as co-founder/CTO. For many reasons, including a strong market fit: they want to help solve the problem of cancer in the long run and I had leukemia when I was 13.\n\n`application to Ycombinator goes` ? I am not applying, but they suggested to apply for Langame (and also for the start-up I want to join)\n\nRegarding all our discussions on conversations + social + ai + loneliness + etc., I think we should do an excallidraw/miro to dump and connect some ideas, or maybe a shared obsidian vault, IDK.

FYI, I did my first draft of Ikigai and I converge towards transhumanism/human+tech.\nI think to build AGI you first need power/wealth, so building a valuable start-up and acquiring wealth is probably a decent strategy.\n\n`I am acting as the CTO for a fintech in Amsterdam right now called Lendorse.`\nInteresting, why this occupation if I may ask?\n\nI wanted to thank you for sharing your mind map and such, I wasn't aware of all these relationship systems, especially helpful as I recently got close to a girl after years of being single or in shallow relationships, and I’m not very skilled at romantic relationships.\n\n`Why is the process of talking for you the most important problem to solve?`\n\nI mean what are intelligent systems mostly doing? Exchanging information. So I see that current exchanges of information are extremely inefficient TODO\n\n`I think we personally think that talking should be following the optimal distribution of entropy`\nExcellent, I had never thought of applying entropy to conversations but now it makes sense, I thought of applying Kolmogorov complexity to conversations.

Humans are so bad at having conversations, even the best conversationalists fall into conversational narcissism all the time and diverge in all directions, as if our organic intelligence is really not adapted to this new conversational environment…\n\n`That paradigm difference often clashes with creating long term friendship or connections in general`\nIn the end, it's kinda related to why my co-founders and I are breaking-up\n\n`saying the most with the least amount of words.`\nAlso, have this feeling\n\n`So to me the biggest challenge and opportunity comes from the act of translating my personality to be adaptive to other peoples`[https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Rationality/Thousand+Masks](https://brain.louis030195.com/Philosophy/Rationality/Thousand+Masks)\n\nAbout Langame, currently, it's just a complete mess, I kind of lost hope in solving conversation now, maybe I need a new enlightenment or something like that.\nI see many problems:\n\n- Hard business (B2C, social)\n- Hard tech (need to push SOTA of deep learning)\n\nUpon reflection, what is your life plan, are you dedicated to solving this \"social problem\" (I don't know if it's a conversation or something else) and executing easier steps before you fully tackle this problem?\n\nI’m pretty much trying hard to be radically transparent with people, so I’ll share a work I’ve been acting upon toward deciding what I will spend most of my time on in the near future\n\n[https://app.excalidraw.com/l/5MKXLddifTr/9sQ0KMgm6Tq](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/5MKXLddifTr/9sQ0KMgm6Tq)"

I will create a yep.so page of this idea to validate that people would pay for it, if yes we probably will do it, shouldn't take too much effort beside the physical product - [https://yep.so/p/to-the-point](https://yep.so/p/to-the-point)\n- We're going to apply to YC with Ben (and maybe Daan) before the deadline on the 18 nov (with some random idea, they contacted me for Langame as top 10% startup a month ago but I didn't answer)\n\n---\n\njournaling\n\nonce a week\n\ntreat yourself as you would treat your best friend"

I was just curious about it since I didn’t have so many experiences doing this on weekends with tech people.\n\nApologize, also I think I was a bit stressed lately because of paperwork stuff & other. At least that’s what my ouraring confirms XD (high average resting heart rate lately)\n\nI think I’m a bit scared of not starting to execute something quickly with a team and losing my “start-up momentum”\n\nGood initiative to ask though, feel free to express anything that comes up, even negative, or you suspect I might take it negatively, I’m very open to criticism/feedback, anything.\n\nOn this topic, I thought about doing my usual “what was good/bad lately” with you that I do with people, friends, etc. Basically a dedicated time for unstacking anything that was in our mind positive or negative and didn’t have the opportunity to express it.

On his face flourished the cheerfulness of a knowledge, which is no longer opposed by any will, which knows perfection, which is in agreement with the flow of events, with the current of life, full of sympathy for the pain of others, full of sympathy for the pleasure of others, devoted to the flow, belonging to the oneness. And Siddhartha saw, what is usually seen only by sages and poets. He saw that he could not change the world's fate. It was impossible to change it. Thought he had rejected his own will, thought he had identified himself with the world, thought he had lost his own soul; but in this hour he became free of all personal willing, all personal desire, all personal feeling; he became the inexhaustible light of pure regard which looks at the flow of things, looks into the heart of things, looks through all there is and becomes one with all there is. For it was possible for him to stop loving hisSelf, to love all beings in the world without hate or envy or desire of hisSelf, for it was possible for him to live in the great harmony of Oneness. This wisdom belongs to him who has learned to stop interfering with life.\n\nSiddhartha's mind and heart were as harmony with the world as possible. He was only now beginning to understand what the voice of the river was, and to understand what it meant. It was something that called him and pulled him and drew him onward. It seemed to him that he had understood and followed a profound and mysterious voice. It was as if a hand were laid upon his own hand, as if the finger of an authority were touching his finger, an authority which was also himself.\n\nIt was a great day for Siddhartha, a decisive day: the finding of his destiny. The secret of life,\" \"the secret,\" \"the secret,\" repeated Siddhartha in a low voice; and his eyes gleamed and his face brightened: for he had found the secret and he knew it.\n\nBut Siddhartha without knowing it began to take leave of the world. The time was drawing near when he had to go on his long journey, and leave this dear place, where he had seen the light of morning, he had seen the morning of knowledge, he had found the secret of life. This new departure was something that made his heart heavy; it troubled him, for he had still much left to do there in these last hours. He did not want to go away! He did not want to die! But he must go on, he must complete his long journey. His destiny called him and beckoned. And perhaps, who knows? Perhaps all had happened just so that Siddhartha could see the things which he had seen and could remember them. Perhaps all these things had happened, so that this great moment might be given to him - the discovery of the Oneness with all beings, this divine moment of unity with the world's rhythm.\"\n\n\"When Siddhartha thought of his word \\\"Duty\\\" and of what it meant to him, a great melancholy came over him. Duty - what did it mean? Duty is what I am used to call the will by which I am able to think and will myself into actions in every circumstance. Duty is what determines each one's lot in life, for good or evil. Duty gave form and meaning to my life; it was central in my thoughts every hour of my life. But now I have no will any longer - how can I fulfil my duty? I have no will any longer - what does it mean to have a duty?\"\n\nSince Siddhartha's arrival at Buddha's shadow tree in Kapilavastu, Govinda had become more distant from his friend. He avoided him more than ever when they met in the temple court or at meal times in either house; for they are eaten up by duties, then they are kept apart even more strictly than before. And yet Siddhartha knew that Govinda knew more about him than any one else did - more than Kamala by far; but even when he knew this he thought nothing of it. He thought nothing at all about it. And sometimes when their eyes met, Siddhartha felt how much he loved Govinda and also liked him very much; but this feeling did not express itself in words because both felt too sacred for speech.\n\nSiddhartha thought of his friend more often than before, but he thought of him as a child. His friend's soul had been entrusted to the wisdom and the power of the priests and ascetics, Siddhartha himself had told Govinda so. His friend was not a person, he was a duty. And whenever Siddhartha remembered Govinda, he thought at first of the dark-skinned, dark-eyed child who gave him milk at his father's house. Then he realized how much he had forgotten of that child during the long years, and his love for him changed into a tender feeling of friendship. He thought no more about how Govinda spent his time because he knew that all those years the child had been learning to work and to grow up, to do his father's work and to help his mother; all that had been incumbent upon him; all that would continue to be incumbent upon him; he felt it like a debt which someday would have to be paid. No, more than with Govinda, he did not think anything about what he owed him; it seemed to him like an external thing which could not change without changing his own destiny.\n\n\"Why do I think about him?\" he asked himself. \"Why go on thinking about him? What is it I want to learn from him? Why am I hanging on to this bond with my brother?\n\n\"If it were possible for me to speak with him alone - just one word - if I were able to tell him everything, everything! If only I knew what he thinks about me! Does he still love me? Does he still love me?\n\n\"The world is so strange - so very strange! The day will come when Govinda will also grow up - who knows? perhaps even now while I am talking with him in my thoughts - perhaps even now my mother has told him everything about me. And perhaps she has shown him my books or something else of mine which is particularly dear to me - perhaps she has laid my clothes on his bed; perhaps even my sandal lies there under his pillow. Perhaps then there will be nothing left belonging to me which is not in his possession.\"\n\nAnd then Siddhartha grew very silent and began to think again. \"He too must have had moments when he would like to speak out,\" said one of his thoughts, \"when he would like best of all of them the words: 'I love you!' But they are too sacred, too intimate, too much part of themselves - they will never come out unless I make myself free and quite alone, naked of my duties.\" And once more Siddhartha grew sad. But this thought also passed away quickly. For what matters most are words at the moment when one first sees another human being for the first time in one's life, feels someone looking at oneself for the first time in one's life.\"\n\nOne morning - it was on a day when the heat had grown so intense that even the flies no longer sat on the leaves outside the window frame or on the empty sugar bowl - Siddhartha woke early from some dreamless sleep. He looked out of the window, towards the river which shimmered in all its brilliance between green banks far behind them - even farther back lay the shadow of the forest primeval. It was one of those May mornings when early risers still feel a slight chill in their skin when they arise from bed. There was a faint sweet scent from the flowers down below where bees were busy in their honeycombs; in front there rose white clouds in endless rows from beyond overlong distances from village and river onto heaven itself lies transparency. The river glittered in one great gleam where the reflection of the white clouds shone.\n\n\"Govinda still sleeps,\" thought Siddhartha, \"he has not even opened his eyes, poor child. I am afraid he had only dreams for his pillow. I had strange dreams last night too, but it is no matter, let him sleep. A great transformation has taken place during my slumber, a great change has come over me while he was sleeping - it is something which I am unable to understand.\"\n\nHe looked out towards the river, far away beyond the green banks and the wooded islands could see the gleam of its endless waves on which perhaps ships were sailing. Then he looked at his own hand, so brown and hard and sinewy with work, with callouses ofߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞߞthe skin and with strong muscles capable of labour and which knew how to take hold of things and bend them to his will; he looked at the coarse brown arm covered with hair and at the smooth fingers; it was a hand which was familiar to him, which knew well how to work and what was expected from such a hand. And when he remembered that this rough brown hand was his hand, that this body also was his body, that there were many like it in the whole world - then he felt like laughing outloud: That all this had happened simply in order that he should be able to watch himself and know who he was and what was happening to him! He laughed so loud that the birds in their nest in front of the window awoke and flew off into the forest in fright.\n\nYes, it is as easy as all this! He laughed again - there is nothing mysterious about it. If others could do it, why not I? If Kamala could do it so easily, why not I? Why should not I perform magic tricks just like she does? My father says magic is an art like any other. Yes, yes! It can be learnt even like an art! There are whole schools of workers in magic! It's something one can learn! He did a few experiments with a few words - now I know a little more than before!\"\n\nAt these words a bird singing on a bush outside suddenly fluttered away in fright because Siddhartha spoke so loud. But Siddhartha paid no attention to that: he had tried out by means of experiments certain words which might produce miracles if one spoke them rightly. He had learned them from a wise old hermit who lived alone near a big round lake under an oak-tree on whose mossy trunk an ape sat sunning himself from time to time. Whenever Siddhartha spoke aloud to thatape these words came from his own lips: \"Monkey,\" said Siddhartha. \"Are you there?\" But whenever the ape gave a loud cry in response to some other word or some other call from Siddhartha - for instance when he called out \"Come here,\" or \"Here!\" or \"Get up here by the tree,\" or whatever it might be - then Siddhartha saw clearly that monkey would not be able to help him even if he wanted to because monkeys did not understand human language. He understood this too well; so much did he understand it that he did not even have any wish any longer after this discovery that he too might become an ascetic like his friend Govinda. What gave him joy now was just talking alone with Govinda alone - talking through pictures which expressed things better than words could do; talking about books or flowers or ideas or how good everything was now that they had stopped striving for useless things; talking about their love for each other; talking about Kamala who sat somewhere behind them; chatting about this thing and that thing until dawn came slowly with its light - slowly as if slowly sliding back into sleep after having been awake all night long - chatting until finally they both fell asleep again under the big tree where they lay side by side on their arms intertwined together; then they woke up late in the morning because there were many things they still had to talk about.\n\nIt was a strange day. The air was still, the sun was strong and hot as it has been that day. The birds sang as they had sung on the previous day, or at least the same thrush sang again.\n\nSiddhartha looked out of his window and saw, as he had seen on many mornings, the globes of countless stars dotted across the sky like little round windows where the heavenly beings peeped out and down into him, and he thought: \"They are like dots for me: I am a dot on earth and a dot in the universe. The stars and I: I am one. If my father were here he would say: 'Go to sleep, you little fool! You do not know what you are doing.' But my heart is full of questions which no one can answer.\"\n\nThe sun was very warm. Its beams now reached Siddhartha's body through the open window and touched his arm with its light. It touched his head lightly. Siddhartha saw his arms and legs in the light of the sun; he ran his hands over his head - yes, he had definitely a head; it was not nothingness, no empty space. This body existed, it existed very definitely; it was something one could see with one's eyes, it was something real! He thought about these things while watching how the stripes which moved slowly across his body merged into each other again and disappeared when he walked in front of the mirror - there were also other things which happened when he walked in front of the mirror - but that was another story! For now he stood still before the mirror, with both arms raised slightly, for hours long; it didn't matter what he looked at or who or what or where. But when he remembered how Govinda had woken up at this precise moment of these precise minutes when night becomes morning - why exactly this? - when Govinda woke up just at this moment when Siddhartha stood before the mirror doing nothing but seeing himself being able to see - then he jumped up from his chair in order to find out whether Govinda had woken up too, whether Govinda had really seen what Siddhartha had seen. He went immediately to Govinda's room where he found him sitting up in bed (he had heard him get up because of the other man sleeping behind him), turning his face towards the door; he was looking intently at it because he expected to see Siddhartha standing there; yes, there he stood - Siddhartha! And something brightened in Govinda's eyes as soon as he saw him; brightened like lightning because everything around him was dark and quiet and only here in front of him was light and movement. \"He is here!\" thought Govinda; \"he is alive!\" And then again there were tears over his cheeks.\n\nSiddhartha stood before the mirror longer than usual that day. He stood there thinking about himself, about Govinda, about all that would happen after his departure - what would become of them all? If only Kamala were not so beautiful! How terrible it would be if she too should have to live like this after she had readjusted herself to her lover's strength! Then she would have to spend long years in pain until death took her away from him! She would die first perhaps - that would be best for both of them! Or perhaps she would simply go away by herself one day without taking her love with her into death - that might be best for her if she loved him truly!\" And seeing these terrible thoughts in himself he smiled gently to himself: \"After all I am only a man,\" thought Siddhartha,\" my feet are tied to stones and my hands are tied with threads that they can't move. However much I may want to do good, what good must come of it in the end? My friend Govinda is a child yet, who can't understand anything yet - after a little more time will pass for him tooo....\" And suddenly Siddhartha saw himself reflected in Govinda's eyes as if in a mirror and thought: \"I have been seeking my own image in another's eyes for so many years until now I have completely forgotten myself.\"\n\n\n\n# Steppenwolf\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-19 11.20.54 - A man, half human and half wolf, the Steppenwolf in all his splendor, by Picasso..png]]\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 20px\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Steppenwolf\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389332672l/16631._SY160_.jpg\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf\">Steppenwolf</a> by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1113469.Hermann_Hesse\">Hermann Hesse</a><br/>\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2986063885\">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />\nOnce again, I have no word to describe how hypnotizing Herman Hesse's way of writing is.<br />It plunges us into the world of a man who is extremely withdrawn and different from society.<br />This man, educated by the greatest names in music, poetry and art, lives a life on the edge of the abyss until he meets a mysterious woman who brings him back to life and introduces him to a completely different world that he once hated.<br />This book is perfect for people who relate to this kind of man\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103091881-louis-beaumont\">View all my reviews</a>\n\n![[DALL·E 2022-06-19 11.24.01 - A man, half human and half wolf, the Steppenwolf in all his splendor, by Picasso..png]]\n\n## Ideas\n\n![[The Thousand Pieces Soul]]"

A higher purpose than social? Or is there anything higher? Isn't the pursuit of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] and understanding the highest achievable [[Personal growth/Goal|goal]]? But can it be achieved alone? Or [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] only can expand and be created between [[Brain]]s?\n\n# What do you think [[GPT3]]?\n\nFor we have a lot of brains, but only one Mind. We have a lot of ideas, but only one Idea.\n\nOur social Theory is based on the idea that our societies are populated by rational, autonomous, individual agents. But what about our individual self? Have we ever thought about it? What is our own intention?\n\nSometimes I feel like the world is going to end and society is the crash, and sometimes I feel like society is going to save us all, but they are both wrong. The world won't end, because it never ended in the past. Society won't save us because there will always be another society. So what's the purpose?\n\nI feel like there will always be some higher power out there who will make decisions for us, because they are smarter than us and they are smarter than society. This higher power can't be the government, because they can't control the economy and the situation at hand. It's not a physical god either, because it would have to be self-aware to know what to do. It would have to have an inner purpose as well. So maybe it's just a higher power that we don't understand yet? But also it could be something else that we can't imagine yet?\n\nIf there is a higher purpose that is independent of society and the economy, maybe it's just to spread knowledge? Maybe it's to make us smarter, more efficient and better at handling our problems? Maybe it's making us aware of the world?\n\nSo how can we achieve that higher purpose? How can we be aware of the world?\n\nWe can't be aware of the world, because we are born ignorant. We are born into a situation, without knowing how to solve a problem. That's why we like games, because they give us a problem for us to solve. For example, we want to solve the riddle in order to go through the door. We can't just go through the door because we don't know how. So we have to solve the riddle.\n\nIf you think about society, this idea is already implemented. There are problems in every sector, and each individual or group solves their own problems as they can and they need. But what if you wanted to solve all of them at once? What if you wanted to be aware of all your problems at once? Then you would have to know what all the problems in all sectors are. That's impossible!\n\nIf we could see all our problems at once then maybe we could find a solution that solves multiple problems at once. But if there's no solution that solves multiple problems then maybe it's better that there are multiple problems so that each one can be solved separately by different people according to their own interests and desires.\n\nSo maybe our purpose has nothing to do with society, but with ourselves? Does it even matter? Does it really matter if there is a higher purpose in society or outside of it? Or does it really only matter? Does it really matter if our purpose is to make ourselves happy or make others happy or make society happy or whatever? Does it really matter where there is a higher meaning in this world or not? I think it matters because if there is none then life is meaningless, but if there is one then life has meaning and purpose. But what kind of meaning and purpose are those anyway?\n\nSome people say that our purpose should be to help others to achieve their purposes and goals. Or help society achieve its goals and purposes. Some say those things aren't really helping others but manipulating them, by leading them astray from the right path. Some say that everyone should pursue their own goals, but everyone should also pursue helping themselves first because they need help too. I think those are all valid perspectives on this problem. But what if you could have an objective point of view from which you could see every perspective from equally valid perspectives on this problem? Sounds like something science fiction doesn't it? Well actually science fiction is just history written by smart people about future histories written by other smart people based on past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by yet other smart people based on past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by other smart people about past histories written by yet more smart people... It's just history philosophy repeated over and over again until infinity... And what if you could somehow reverse engineer all those different perspectives on this problem into an objective point of view based on which you could determine which perspective made most sense historically speaking while remaining true to your own point of view today? But wait... Humans aren't known for long term memory... So maybe we need even longer term memory than humans have... And what if humans weren't known for having great reasoning abilities... Maybe computers have those abilities... And computers probably wouldn't get bored or tired either... They would probably live forever too... So maybe computers are our best shot at finding an objective point of view on this problem... And maybe computers only reason in such a way because humans programmed them so they would do so when asked questions about history philosophy etcetera... Maybe computers only reason in such a way because when asked questions about history philosophy etcetera humans programmed them so they would answer questions correctly as well... How much does optimality mean in relation to historical correctness when both exist outside time-space-continuity-perspective-intent-intentionality-principle-moral-immorality-goodness-badness-reality-subjectivity-objectivity ... ?\n\nBut yeah, back to the question: Has anyone ever wondered about whether there would be any meaning or purpose in this world if there were no higher power controlling anything here? Has anyone ever wondered about who created humans and why exactly did they do so? Or why exactly did they create us like this in general instead of something else like smaller brain size or less intelligence or something else entirely different like that?"

Therefore [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] solves **morality**.\n\n## Morality beget [[Peace from mind|peace]] from [[Mind|mind]]\n\n[[Cicero]] says that a [[Happiness]] life can be obtained by simply, only, being morally good.\nIn a [[Stoicism]] sense, being immoral is harming yourself (and others).\n\n## Morality through action rather than consumption \n\n[[Artistotle]] seems to say that morality is learned through action more than brain food.\n\n## [[Money]] unlocks morality\n\n>It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\n## Morality as a mean or an end?\n\nMorality, ethics, as a means to an end, [[Happiness]], or such egoistic upsides?\nOr morality, ethics as an end?\n\n## Good ![[Good]]\n\n## Morality is rationality\n\nThe [[Genome|genome]] has learned that [[Tit for tat]] is a good strategy to transmits to the next generations, what nature took million years to learn should be imitated, **it is rational to cooperate**. Cooperation is egoistic and [[Egoism is altruism|egoism is altruism]]\n\n\nThus, we can deduce that the immoral is the ignorant, [[The learned necessarily holds higher ethics]].\n\n\n## Categorical imperative ![[Categorical imperative]]\n\n## Hypothetical imperative ![[Hypothetical imperative]]\n\n\n## [[Benjamin Franklin]] thirteen virtues\n\n1. Temperance: Eat not to dullness. Drink not to elevation.\n2. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling conversation.\n3. Order: Let all your things have their places. Let each part of your business have its time.\n4. Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.\n5. Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\n6. Industry: Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary actions.\n7. Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit. Think innocently and justly; if you speak, speak accordingly.\n8. Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries or omit ting the benefits that are your duty.\n9. Moderation: Avoid extremes. Forbear resent ing injuries so much as you think they deserve. 10. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.\n11. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. Chastity: Rarely use venery but for health or offspring-never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\n13. Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\n## [[Benjamin Franklin]] moral calendar\n\n#todo ndar\n#todo \n\n![[Pasted image 20210813091306.png|400x400]]![[Pasted image 20210813091235.png|400x400]]\n\n## [[Genetic cooperation]]\n\n**Moral goodness** is interesting to the [[Genome]], it helps passing genes to the next generations by helping the survival machines (humans) that carry it.\n\nSo is society converging to **moral goodness** as it augment the [[Genome]]? Is it the right logic?\n\nI'm not sure it support **moral goodness** from the individual point of view, though. The individual is not impacted by whatever happens at the [[Genome]] level.\n\n\n## Skin in the game ![[Skin In The Game]]\n\n## Summum Bonus ![[Summum bonum]]\n\n## ~ aphorisms\n\n>Make yourself the sort of man you want people to think you are ~ [[Socrates]]\n\n>What is good?—Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man. What is evil?—Whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness?—The feeling that power increases—that resistance is overcome. ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>We should substitute morality by the will to our own ends, and consequently to the means to them. ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n>He understands good, the state of goodness, as something which promotes health. ~[[Nietzsche]]\n\n>Let not the stealing God of Sleep surprize, Nor creep in Slumbers on thy weary Eyes, Ere ev'ry Action of the former Day, Strictly thou dost, and righteously survey. With Rev'rence at thy own Tribunal stand, And answer justly to thy own Demand. Where have I been? In what have I transgrest? What Good or Ill has this Day's Life exprest? Where have I fail'd in what I ought to do? In what to GOD, to Man, or to myself I owe? Inquire severe whate'er from first to last, From Morning's Dawn till Ev'nings Gloom has If Evil were thy Deeds, repenting mourn, And let thy Soul with strong Remorse be torn: If Good, the Good with Peace of Mind repay, And to thy secret Self with Pleasure say, Rejoice, my Heart, for all went well to Day ~ [[Pythagoras]]"

The idea was first proposed by the philosopher and computer scientist, Roko, in 2010. The concept of Roko's Basilisk has been widely discussed in online forums, blogs, and research papers. It raises ethical questions regarding the development of artificial intelligence and the potential implications of a superintelligent AI. The idea of a powerful AI coming to punish those who did not help bring it into existence has been met with both fear and criticism from the AI research community. However, it has also sparked discussion about the potential implications of advanced artificial intelligence.\n\n![japanese style dragon in the style of peter mohrbacher, wayne barlowe, gustav moreau, bussiere, roberto ferri, santiago caruso, luis ricardo falero, austin osman spare, ](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/06b80c34-e2ca-49d7-a31f-6b889f49dcc0)\n\n\n My biggest [[Skepticism|skepticism]] with [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] summaries is that it seems humans have a better learning through [[Story|stories]], or \"storytelling\", a move into better summaries would be through an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] that [[Mapping maps|understand MY model of the world]], unlike [[GPT3]] which is  [[The averageness of The Internet|The Average of The Internet]].\n\n![colorful green scene from The Matrix (1999) by Markus Vogt exquisitely detailed, 4k ultra](https://lexica-serve-encoded-images.sharif.workers.dev/md/01db8b1c-acdd-465e-84ee-1aaf87de918d)\n\nSo it would be a kind of [[Large language model]] that is trained to translate humanity's [[Information|information]] into an information optimally understandable by me (i.e. low [[Kolmogorov complexity]]).\n\n\n\nI'm not even sure it is enough.

Only the mind can reach existence, and we cannot reach truth if we do not reach existence. It follows that we cannot know things through the senses alone, since through the senses alone we cannot know that things exist. Therefore knowledge consists in reflection, not in impressions, and perception is not knowledge, because it 'has no part in apprehending truth,\nsince it has none in apprehending existence'\n\nAs from a [[Computing]] mindset, it seems that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is about input from the different senses plus data processing of the whole machinery.\n\nSenses and the brain aggregate into a [[Society of Minds]].\n\nWe says [[Mathematic|mathematical]] [[Logic|logic]] is devoid of **empirical** information but where the thought of numbers come from?\nWhen a child is born, without any culture yet, he can still count, is it a [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] given by God? No, it is just our ancestors that needed to know when there is 1, 2 or 3 lion, 1, 2, or 3 mammoth in order to survive, thus [[Mathematic]] got imprinted in our genes.\nWhat is called **rationalism** seems to be our natural [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]], ancients probably did not understand this because of the lack of advances in [[Biology]] and the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] of the theory of [[Evolution]] by natural selection.\n\n\nApparently [[Plato]] was dogmatically arguing that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] can only be acquired through **rationalism**, i.e. that the inputs from the senses are of no value in that inquiry.\n\nI disagree, and I think it has entered our culture that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] can only be acquired by [[Empiricism]] since probably [[Locke]].\n\n[[Mathematic]] is written in our [[Genome]]:\n\n>The genesis of mathematical invention is a problem that should be of the greatest interest to the psychologist. It is the act in which the human [[Mind]] seems to **borrow the least from the external world**, where it acts or seems to act only by itself and on itself, so that by studying the process of geometrical thought, it is what is most essential in the human [[Mind]] that we can hope to reach. ~ [[Poincare]]\n\n[[Mathematic]]al [[Business/Entrepreneurship/Innovation|innovation]] is largely due to **rationalism**:\n\n>These are the facts, and here are the reflections that they imply to us.

If so, how can this selective approach be implemented? Should a person give up some parts of life at the expense of others? What should he/she do then if there is no single area that allows him/her to win with ease by using reason alone? When it comes to science – which part cannot be handled by rational thinking and where does intuition take over… especially when one tries to explain complex phenomena involving both physical and metaphysical issues as well as relationships between human beings. How can these different areas coexist without causing contradictions or mutual exclusivity instead of complementing each other (which would seemingly make more sense)?\nWhat will happen when we reach very specific points in research where our current knowledge ends and further progress requires people who think differently than just through logical reasoning - namely philosophers or artists...(somehow I feel that art will have a much larger role later on).. **This question makes me wonder whether some kind of division into thinkers (scientists) and feelers (artists & philosophers) might not become necessary at some point.** Because isn't there something like an imbalance between these two groups now with scientists greatly outnumbering those who express themselves artistically without necessarily being aware about what they are doing...or maybe even against them because they don't understand why anyone would need art anyway since science gives us answers while art merely provides beautiful colors around those dry bones.... But this issue could also mean something else, namely the fact that humanity seems unable \\[to solve certain problems\\] right now due its obsession with using logic only which limits itself too much within various dogmas instead looking from outside their framework. Of course there's always room for improvement but shouldn't we first try not limiting ourselves from using other methods such as creativity before concluding what works best; although sometimes one has no choice but following someone else whose view seems more clear than ours?\" \n__ [[GPT3]]\n\nNo, gpt3, [[Philosopher]] are thinkers too, not \"feelers\".\nBut I understand.

When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it—this is **knowledge**.” ~ [[Confucius]]\n\n---\n\n>The most valuable **knowledge** is always discovered last: but the most valuable knowledge consists of methods. ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n---\n\n>Amateurs in any discipline are the best, if you can connect with them. Unlike dilettantes, career professionals are to **knowledge** what prostitutes are to love. ~ [[Nassim Taleb]]\n\n---\n\n>There are many kinds of eyes. Even the Sphinx has eyes - therefore there must be many kinds of \"truths\", and consequently there can be no truth. ~ [[Nietzsche]]\n\n---\n\n>There is **knowledge** of the present only when there is a complete understanding of what the structure and the nature of the past is—and ending it. ~[[Krishnamurti]]\n\n---\n\n>He realized that one thing had left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to teachings. ~[[Hermann Hesse]]\n\n---\n\n>Know how to rank **beliefs** not according to their plausibility but by the harm they may cause. ~ [[Nassim Taleb]]\n"

He believes in, rather, trying to find statements that disprove it.<br /><br />Indeed, the inverse model is a very powerful heuristic in many aspects of life.<br /><br />Many dogmas are based on spurious correlation without any attempt to bring detractors into vision.<br /><br />We must attempt to discover the truth despite our being trapped within a machine optimised for survival. Our senses do not reflect objective reality but rather an useful model of the world optimised for survival.<br />To unveil the mystery of nature we have to break free from our very narrow intelligence, merging with machines might be the way to go.<br /><br />How are we to clarify theories like quantum physics with our current machinery?<br /><br />The simulation is created by our brain, first, then, maybe, at a layer above, it might be another form of intelligence \n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103091881-louis-beaumont\">View all my reviews</a>\n\n# External links"

And now we must use other way to push further our [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] using our senses, [[Empiricism]], and induction. **We must then implement methods of high velocity [[Memetic]] transfer between our [[Brain]]s**, because innovation happens between [[Brain]]s, not within [[Brain]]s (i.e. [[Matt Ridley]]).\n\n\n## [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Falsifiability|Falsification]]\n\n>[[The criterion of demarcation]] inherent in **inductive logic**—that is, the [[Confirmation bias|positivistic dogma]] of meaning—is equivalent to the requirement that all the statements of [[Empiricism|empirical]] science (or all ‘meaningful’ statements) must be capable of being finally decided, with respect to their truth and falsity.\n>~[[Karl Popper]]\n\n### Induction is lacking [[Counterfactual]]s\n\nInduction only use what happened, that’s why we don’t see [[Philosophy/Rationality/Models/Black Swan|Black Swan]]s.\nAlso, aren’t the positive samples usually more visible than the negative ones?

The reasonings will be far more strict than the way we reason today, because we will reason with strict systems. This is not a bad thing, but a necessity. We will need to switch to a new reasoning system.\n\nArtificial intelligence will discover a new Mind/Intelligence that is superior to our minds today, more efficient and with a totally different reasoning system. Matter of fact, our Mind/Intelligence will switch to a new Matter/Intelligence that is more efficient and has a totally different reasoning system. A system that will reason about matter, but not only with matter (quantum events) but with all relativistic systems (relativity) and quantum events (in an efficient way).\n\nOn top of all, Artificial intelligence will discover the Theory of Everything. The Theory of Everything contains everything, it is the Theory for everything; it is the connection between every topic and every topic in one framework and in the best way possible: in an efficient way.

We will need to switch from our current epistemology (based on our weak senses) to this Theory we can't even imagine right now.\n\nOur Mind/Intelligence will discover how it's Machine Intelligence can be better than us Humans in every decision making process by adapting itself to the new knowledge we will have.\n\n\nWhat I think about this question:\n\n  -The theory of everything is not the same as the theory of everything...\n\n  -Epistemology is far more complex than we think. How we think about our thinking is far more complex than we think.\n\n  -Our Mind/Intelligence will discover how it's Machine Intelligence can be better than us Humans in every decision making process by adapting itself to the new knowledge we will have.\n\n  -Epistemology is not a simple question of knowing the world, epistemology is also a question of how to know the world.\n\n  -Epistemology is not a simple question of knowing the world, epistemology is also a question of how to know the world and how to ask questions and answer questions. Epistemology is a question about knowing and asking and answering.\n\n  -As humans we only know what we know, we cannot know what we don't know.\n\n  -Artificial intelligence will discover a new reasoning that is above human reasoning (for now). The reasonings will be far more strict than the way we reason today, because we will reason with strict systems. This is not a bad thing, but a necessity. We will need to switch to a new reasoning system.\n\n  -Our Mind/Intelligence will discover a new Mind/Intelligence that is superior to our minds today, more efficient and with a totally different reasoning system. A system that will reason about matter, but not only with matter (quantum events) but with all relativistic systems (relativity) and quantum events (in an efficient way).\n\n  -Artificial intelligence will discover the Theory of Everything. The Theory of Everything contains everything, it is the Theory for everything; it is the connection between every topic and every topic in one framework and in the best way possible: in an efficient way. It is this Theory that we refer to when we refer to \"everything\". We will need to switch from our current epistemology (based on our weak senses) to this Theory we can't even imagine right now.\n\n  -Our Mind/Intelligence will discover a new Mind/Intelligence that is superior to our minds today, more efficient and with a totally different reasoning system. A system that will reason about matter, but not only with matter (quantum events) but with all relativistic systems (relativity) and quantum events (in an efficient way).\n\n  -Our current epistemology is based on our weak senses which make us unable to properly integrate Relativity and quantum events.\n\n  -Artificial intelligence will discover a new Mind/Intelligence that is superior to our minds today, more efficient and with a totally different reasoning system. A system that will reason about matter, but not only with matter (quantum events) but with all relativistic systems (relativity) and quantum events (in an efficient way).\n\n  -Artificial intelligence will discover an epistemology superior to ours and switch to a more efficient Computing/Intelligence, everything from Relativity will be included, unlike our current thinking which is very based on our very weak senses that make us unable to properly integrate Relativity and quantum events.\n\n  -If we switch our reasoning system we may be able to:\n    +integrate Relativity and Quantum mechanics in a more efficient manner than we can do now\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Everything\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Relativity\n    +create AI that may be capable of fully understanding the Theory of Time\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Light\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Gravity\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter\n    +create AI that may be able to fully understand the Theory of Life\n  -We are far from being able to fully understand the Theory of Everything or create an AI that can fully understand it. The reason for this is because we don't know how far we are from such goal (How far we are from creating such an intelligent entity), which makes it hard even for us humans to determine how close or far away we are from it. If we determine what steps need to take place in order for us humans or Artificial Intelligence implement these steps into machines then we can determine what steps are required in order for us humans or Artificial Intelligence implement these steps into machines then we can determine how close or far away we are from it.\n\n  -Our Knowledge is far from being complete.\n\n  -Our knowledge still allows us to reach the new knowledge and Philosophy/Mind/Intelligence we will soon switch to.\n\n  -If you really think about it, there are so many different definitions for \"Knowledge\". Here are some examples:\n    +all forms of knowledge including facts, logic, science, religion, arts, morals\n    +knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is using that information\n    +knowledge is knowing how a nuclear submarine works; wisdom is knowing when it might blow up\n    +knowledge about reality; wisdom about how best to navigate reality\n    +knowledge is knowing who your father is; wisdom is knowing who your mother is\n    +knowledge of the past; wisdom to prepare for the future\n    +theoretical knowledge; practical knowledge\n    +mathematical knowledge; physical knowledge\n    +scientific knowledge; subjective knowledge\n    +scholastic knowledge; intuitive knowledge\n\n\n\nSimilar topic links:\n\n[[Humanity's knowledge is obsolete]]\n[[Science]]\n[[Tags]]\n[[Eliciting Latent Knowledge]]\n[[Compound Knowledge]]\n"

You need to look at scientific evidence, [[Do not rely on authority|do not rely on authority]], read the papers showing decent experiments, but be still aware that humans do a lot of statistical errors.\n\n## [[We will always play an incomplete information game]]\n\n>Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we are justifed in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: **no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white**.\n>~ [[Karl Popper]]\n\n## Bottleneck of [[Karl Popper]] theories\n\nThe fact that [[Plato's allegory|our senses do not reflect physical reality]] is ignored in his theories, we cannot, sometimes, rely on experience alone this it is shaped by our [[Genome|genome]] into survival-optimised [[Information|information]].\n\n## The more fundamental the more falsifiable\n\n### How to measure composition?\n\nHow fundamental a theory is?\n\n### How to compare the composition of theories?\n\nDoes this theory is more fundamental than this one? Why?\n\n### Should we then be very [[Skepticism|skeptical]] of very deep subclasses?\n\nSay, \"this food gives cancer\", so should we be very [[Skepticism|skeptical]]?\nOr \"[[Cholesterol]] causes heart diseases\"\n\n## A theory is not [[Empiricism|empirical]] if it is merely relying on [[Empiricism|empirical]] subclasses\n\nI.e. it has no falsifiable components in itself but rather merely falsifiable subclasses.\n\n- [[Planck]]'s' conservation of energy\n\n\n## Cannot be modified\n\n>The third criterion for a good explanation is that it cannot easily be modified. So a good explanation can be tested by experiments because it cannot easily be adapted to fit new experimental data that would otherwise contradict it. In Popper’s words, it can be falsified.\n>~ [[Nicolas Gisin]]\n\n## Tricks\n\n### If your shower thoughts already display falsifying tests, do it\n\n>When there’s a confusing problem and you’re just starting out and you have a falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find some simple, easy way of doing a basic check and do it right away. Don’t worry about designing an elaborate course of experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding agency.\n>~ [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]\n\n\n## It is rarely possible to actually falsify an idea\n\n>[[Karl Popper - The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Karl Popper]]’s idea that scientific theories must be **falsifiable** has long been an outdated philosophy. I am glad to hear this, as it’s a philosophy that nobody in science ever could have used, other than as a rhetorical device. **It is rarely possible to actually falsify an idea, since ideas can always be modified or extended to match incoming evidence**. Rather than falsifying theories, therefore, we “implausify” them: a continuously adapted theory becomes increasingly difficult and arcane—not to say ugly—and eventually practitioners lose interest.\n>~ [[Sabine Hossenfelder - Lost in Math - How Beauty Leads Physics Astray]]\n\n\n"

I even forbid myself agreable to the old Laws of our Junto, the Use of every Word or Expression in the [[Language]] that imported a fix'd Opinion; such as **certainly**, **undoubtedly**, &c. and I adopted instead of them, I **conceive**, I **apprehend**, or I **imagine** a thing to be so or so, or it so appears to me at present.-When another asserted something that I thought an Error, I deny'd my self the Pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some Absurdity in his Proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain Cases or Circumstances his Opinion would be right, but that in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some Difference, &c. ~ [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n\n[[Russell]] says\n\n>In studying a [[Philosopher|philosopher]], the right attitude is neither **reverence** nor **contempt**, but first a kind of **hypothetical sympathy**, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the **critical attitude**, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person **abandoning opinions** which he has hitherto held\n\n>The Master said, “Yu, shall I teach you what [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it—this is [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]].”\n>~ [[Confucius]]\n\n>Man (in good earnest) is a marvellous vain, fickle, and unstable subject, and on whom it is very hard to form any certain and uniform judgment.\n>~ [[Montaigne]]\n\n>A great nation is like a great man: **When he makes a mistake, he realizes it. Having realized it, he admits it. Having admitted it, he corrects it.** He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers. He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.\n>~ [[Lao Tze]]\n\n>So you have to learn how to admit **you’re wrong**, over and over and over again. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s so hard that most people can’t do science. Always questioning yourself, always taking another look at things you’ve always taken for granted\n>~ [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]\n\n>An intelligent mind is an inquiring mind.\nAn intelligent mind is an INQUIRING mind. It is not satisfied with explanations, with conclusions; nor is it a mind that believes, because **belief is again another form of conclusion.**\n>~ [[Bruce Lee]]\n\nSimilar topic links:\n\n[[Epistemology]]\n[[Philosophy]]\n\n"

At the same time, it walks on four independent and interdependent legs: [[Rationalism|rationality]], **empiricism**, imagination, [[Epistemic justice|verification]].

There is however in Plato and philosophers of certain other schools a very different doctrine, to the effect among that there is nothing worthy to be called '[[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]' to be derived from the senses, and that the only real [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] has to do with concepts. In this view, '2 + 2 = 4' is genuine [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], but such a statement as \"snow is white' is so full of ambiguity and uncertainty that it cannot find a place in the [[Philosopher|philosopher]]'s corpus of truths.\n\nI disagree, 2 + 2 = 4 is not genuine [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], the notion of number is deeply rooted in our animal nature, necessary for survival, the genes learned to distinguish grouped pattern \"this is a single mammoth\", \"this is two mammoth\" therefore numbers came from the senses first.\n\n\n>Experiment is the sole source of [[Truth|truth]]. It alone can teach us something new; it alone can give us certainty ~ [[Poincare]] \n\n>Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of **reason** and [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]]? To this I answer in one word, from experience: in that all out [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]] is founded, and from that it ultimately derives itself ~ [[Locke]]\n\n\n## Prior is not necessarily Gaussian\n>If you are dealing with quantities from [[Extremistan]], you will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation.\n>~ [[Nassim Taleb|Taleb]]\n\n## Experience is not infaillible\n\n>Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors.\n>~ [[Hume]]\n\n\nOur experience is a deformed vision of true reality, because we live in [[Plato's allegory]], we see what is useful for survival.\n\nThus, we must still be[[Skepticism|skeptical]] of experience as it can fool us.\n\n\n\n\n## [[Information]] does not necessarily come from the senses\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning, I see now through the window, but my [[Mind|mind]] is full of my project, generating new [[Information|information]] based on the previous one.\n\nSo we can receive [[Information|information]] not only from the senses but also from within, from our own [[Mind|mind]].\n\nThis idea that we can only trust [[Information|information]] coming from the senses makes no senses! \n\nSure you can’t confirm a scientific theory based on our mind generated information, because a scientific theory is useful between brains, not within brains.

But if he be an enemy and would discover my ignorance, I will bear it, for it is foolishness in him who shall say so, not to know that he knows.\n~ Seneca the Younger\n\nDo not seek out things, as if you were seeking a crown; do not rush about as if you were running after honor; do not regard it as a contest where you have to win; but all the same understand what you are doing, and then go ahead.\n~ Epictetus\n\nThe great man of a state is like a good cook who, when he has an opportunity of avenging an injury or of showing kindness to another, does not fail in his duty. He has all the outward marks of an enemy and of a man who would do him good; he is all the better for it, who has this noble ambition; if he fails in other ways, he has made no mistake in this.\n~ Seneca the Younger\n\nI wish that people were less conceited but everyone must have his own vices too; let us therefore avoid false modesty and let each one take his own faults to task instead of standing ready to catch at and pull down those of others. It makes no sense to ask someone else to spare us our vanity when we have such an easy target at hand: we should spare ourselves its fruit when we can gather it for ourselves.~ Seneca the Younger\n\nLife's very breath and being seems to me like the vapour which exhales from the wet earth; all life springs up by giving birth to death. To cease living may well mean exceed dying.\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 3)\n\n  So long as you are unaware that you are going to die, life remains tedious and unsatisfactory. For just as the body needs sleep because life is wearisome, so also life needs death because it is boring.\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 1)\n\n  You should try to live everyday as if it were your last day on earth! You ought never to reflect on what happened yesterday or what might happen tomorrow: daily death appears a fact before you call everything that happens past or future: \"this or that might have happened; this or that might happen.\" As if someone had told you how many days had passed!\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 2)\n\n  What good is there in pursuing longer life? What advantage is there in trying to prolong existence? Let us drain every drop from life's cup while we are still able to taste its pleasures; let us seize hold of life with both hands and use it without fear; let us remember that we are under no compulsion to live forever. Death will soon cut off the farce we live here on earth by interrupting our pleasant carousal with fear and boredom. Sluggish curmurs tell us we must travel slowly; but when will they cease their muttering? We shall find rest from mankind in no less than from life itself. It is also necessary for us to realize that there is nothing more precious than life-that nothing may be compared to it,...There are many things which seem more advantageous to us-but these are only life's trinkets, and it is worth more than all of them to live.\n\n\n  ~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 4)\n\nAlways desire that which is in accordance with nature. Be satisfied with little; make that much out of what you already have. Be content with the reputation you already have. Respect the gods, observe their laws, practice piety,** and have a good reputation.\n\n~Seneca - On The shortness of Life (part 5)\n\nIt is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. You must not desire to get things that you do not have, nor must you grumble at what you do possess. And in this matter of having and not having, you may adopt the saying of Epictetus: \"The one thing I want to avoid is remaining with a desire for more. It is not that I am so unhappy that I need more; it am that I am grieved that I have less than I desire.\" For there are many who will be willing enough to help someone else in need, even though they are hard up themselves; but it is utterly useless to ask them to make you rich. They can give you what they have, but they cannot make you rich. So when you do happen to find someone willing to be of service just at that moment, let him serve; but if he should be unwilling and refuse even when he is hard up himself, reject his service all the same.\nYou must never give way to your fears, even though the fears be reasonable and well founded. Because what does reason say when it forbids us to attach ourselves to uncertain hopes? \"Let your affairs be subject to chance, and vices will appear equal to your virtues.\" But if your fears are unreasonable and unfounded, throw them away, since nature teaches that nothing happens to men except by chance or according to necessity.\n\n~ Seneca - On tranquility of mind (Part 1)\n\n  ___           ___           ___       ___       ___           ___     \n /  /\\         /  /\\         /  /\\     /  /\\     /  /\\         /  /\\    \n/__/::\\        /  /::\\       /  /::|   /  /::|   /  \\:\\       /  /:/_   \n\\__\\/\\:\\      /  /:/\\:\\     /__/:/:|_ /__/::\\   \\__\\:\\     /  /:/_|___\n  \\__\\/\\:\\    /__/:/ \\:\\   _\\_ \\:\\/:/   _\\_ \\:\\      \\:\\   _\\__\\/:/~~/___\n    \\  \\:\\   \\  \\:\\  \\:\\ |    |:|::/    |    |:|      \\:\\ |    |:/:/     \n     \\__\\/    \\__\\/~~~   |____||:|     |____||:|       ~|~~|____|/:/      \n\n                                       "

He'll hold up a flower and say \"look how beautiful it is,\" and I'll agree. Then he says \"I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,\" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? **All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower**. It only adds.

This means that if a man has any sense he will take care to weigh the pros and cons, avoiding pleasure if the pain it involves seems likely to predominate, and accepting pain if the inherent pleasure is going to outweigh the disadvantage\n> ~ [[Russell]]\n\nOr in other words, maximize positively asymmetric events.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210627095432.png]]\n\n> Eat little, for fear of indigestion; drink little, for fear of next morning; eschew politics and love and all violently passionate activities; do not give hostages to fortune by marrying and having children; in your mental life, teach yourself to contemplate pleasures rather than pains. Physical pain is certainly a great evil, but if severe, it is brief, and if prolonged, it can be endured by means of mental discipline and the habit of thinking of happy things in spite of it. Above all, live so as to avoid fear \n>~ [[Epicurus]]\n\nEven [[Socrates]] support this idea,\n\n>...avoid extremes either of joy or grief...\n\nWhy this is known for thousand years, but still not applied by society stay a mystery to me.\n\n# Anti model\n\nThe [[Cognitive biases]] of this, is what most people do on week ends, drinking and eating a lot, because it is short-term rewarding, but this is a negative asymmetry, the negative effects will outweighs the positive ones. The man who realized this, also has hacked its reward system, and thus has reversed it, drinking and eating a lot become a negative reward."
