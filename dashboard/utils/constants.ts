What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br \/>  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal." }, { "Id": 43, "ProductId": "B001EO5QW8", "UserId": "A16XFOYQSJREL7", "ProfileName": "Roger Pugliese", "HelpfulnessNumerator": 0, "HelpfulnessDenominator": 0, "Score": 5, "Time": 1287014400, "Summary": "Food-Great", "Text": "I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.<br \/>It is a great product.
